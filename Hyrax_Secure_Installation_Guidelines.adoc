== Introduction

Security is an important and unfortunately complex issue. Any computer
security expert will tell you that the best way to keep your systems
secure is to never, ever, let them have network access. Obviously that's
not really what you had in mind or you wouldn't be thinking about
installing Hyrax. You can improve the security of Hyrax using a number
of mechanisms, from following best practices for installation, to
requiring secure authentication for the entire server.

*Disclaimer:* At OPeNDAP we consider security to be a top priority.
However, we are not security experts. What follows is a summary of what
we currently know to be the most effective methods for securing your
Hyrax installation.

== Best Practices For Secure Installation

*Always use a firewall* - Keep your Hyrax server behind a firewall and
configure the firewall to only forward requests to the appropriate port
(typically 8080 for Tomcat and 80 for Apache) on your Hyrax system. Be
sure to have the firewall block direct access to the BES.

*Separate the BES and the OLFS* - We feel that it is better to run the
BES on a second machine where *only* the BES port is open, and where the
BES system is completely blocked by the firewall.

*Restrict Log and Configuration File Access* - It is an unfortunate fact
that many (if not most) IT security problems arise from within an
organization and not from outside attacks. Given this situation it is
important to restrict access to the log files generated, and the
configuration files used, by Hyrax.

* _Log Files_ - Logs can reveal how the code works and allow a hostile
observer to interact with the server and view important details about
the resulting effect.
* _Configuration Files_ - By default Hyrax comes with logging set up to
record access and errors. This can be further reduced if one desires.
However unrestricted access to the Hyrax configuration files could allow
a hostile individual to turn on extensive logging in order to learn more
about the system.
* _*Secure the logs, secure the configuration.*_

*Run Hyrax as a Restricted user.* - We strongly recommend that you run
Hyrax as a restricted user. Running Hyrax as _root_ or the _super user_
is actively discouraged, as doing so creates the potential for dire
consequences. What this means is that you should create a special user
for bot the BES and Tomcat. These users should have restricted
privileges and should only be allowed to write to the directories
required by Tomcat and the BES.

* Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) article on how to secure
Tomcat:

* Tomcat 6 uses a different directory structure, has some logging
changes, and has done away with the need for a deployment descriptor for
a web app. There's an overview in this Covalent presentation:

== Restricting System Access

One may also choose to restrict user access to Hyrax. This can be done
by configuring Tomcat to demand user authentication, and if required,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer[TSL/SSL].

For Tomcat 5.x see:

* <<OLFS-config, Our instructions for enabling Tomcat User Autentication>>
* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/index.html[Tomcat 5.x
Documentation]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/realm-howto.html[Section 6:
Configuring/Managing User Realms]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/ssl-howto.html[Section 12:
Configuring SSL]

For Tomcat 6.x see:

* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/index.html[Tomcat 6.x
Documentation]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/realm-howto.html[Section 6:
Configuring/Managing User Realms]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[Section 12:
Configuring SSL]

Requiring user authentication and using SSL doesn't actually change
Hyrax's vulnerability to attack, but it willl increase the security of
your server by:

* Limiting the number of users to those with authentication credentials.
* Protecting those authentication credentials by using SSL encryption.
* Protecting data content by transmitting it in an encrypted form.
