== Introduction
A _joinNew_ aggregation joins existing datasets along a new outer Array
dimension. Essentially, it adds a new index to the existing variable
which points into the values in each member dataset. One useful example
of this aggregation is for joining multiple samples of data from
different times into one virtual dataset containing all the times. We
will first provide a basic introduction to the joinNew aggregation, then
demonstrate examples for the various ways to specify the members
datasets of an aggregation, the values for the new dimension's
coordinate variable (map vector), and ways to specify metadata for this
aggregation.

The reader is also directed to a basic tutorial of this NcML aggregation
which may be found at
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/ncml/Aggregation.html#joinNew

A _joinNew_ aggregation combines a variable with data across _n_
datasets by creating a new _outer dimension_ and placing the data from
aggregation member _i_ into the element _i_ of the new outer dimension
of size __n__. By "outer dimension" we mean a slowest varying dimension
in a row major order flattening of the data (an example later will
clarify this). For example, the array **A**[__day__][__sample__] would
have the _day_ dimension as the outer dimension. The data samples all
must have the same data syntax; specifically the DDS of the variables
must all match. For example, if the _aggregation variable_ has name
*sample* and is a 10x10 Array of float32, then all the member datasets
in the aggregation must include a variable named *sample* which are all
also 10x10 Arrays of float32. If there were 100 datasets specified in
the aggregation, the resulting DDS would contain a variable named
*sample* that was now of data shape 100x10x10.

In addition, a new _coordinate variable_ specifying data values for the
new dimension will be created at the same scope as (a sibling of) the
specified aggregation variable. For example, if the new dimension is
called "filename" and the new dimension's values are unspecified (the
default), then an Array of type String will be created with one element
for each member dataset --- the filename of the dataset. Additionally,
if the aggregation variable was represented as a DAP Grid, this new
dimension coordinate variable will _also_ be added as a new Map vector
inside the Grid to maintain the Grid specification.

There are multiple ways to specify the member datasets of a joinNew
aggregation:

* **Explicit**: Specifying a separate <netcdf> element for each dataset
* **Scan**: scan a directory tree for files matching a conjunction of
certain criteria:
** Specific suffix
** Older than a specific duration
** Matching a specific regular expression
** Either in a specific directory or recursively searching
subdirectories

Additionally, there are multiple ways to specify the new coordinate
variable's (the new outer dimension's associated data variable) data
values:

* **Default**: An Array of type String containing the filenames of the
member datasets
* **Explicit Value Array**: Explicit list of values of a specific data
type, exactly one per dataset
* **Dynamic Array**: a numeric Array variable specified using start and
increment values -- one value is generated automatically per dataset
* **Timestamp from Filename**: An Array of String with values of ISO
8601 Timestamps extracted from scanned dataset filenames using a
specified Java SimpleDataFormat string. (Only works with <scan>
element!)

== A Simple Self-Contained Example

First, we start with a simple purely virtual (no external datasets)
example to give you a basic idea of this aggregation. This
example will join two one-dimensional Arrays of int's of length 5. The
variable they describe will be called **V**. In this example, we assume
we are joining samples of some variable *V* where each dataset is
samples from 5 stations on a single day. We want to join the datasets so
the new outer dimension is the day, resulting in a 2x5 array of int
values for **V**.

Here's our NcML, with comments to describe what we are doing:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- A simple pure virtual joinNew aggregation of type Array<int>[5][2]  -->

<netcdf title="Sample joinNew Aggregation on Pure NCML Datasets">
  
  <!-- joinNew forming new outer dimension "day" -->
  <aggregation type="joinNew" dimName="day">
    
    <!-- For variables with this name in child datasets -->
    <variableAgg name="V"/>

    <!-- Datasets are one-dimensional Array<int> with cardinality 5. -->
    <netcdf title="Sample Slice 1">
      <!-- Must forward declare the dimension size -->
      <dimension name="station" length="5"/>
      <variable name="V" type="int" shape="station">
    <values>1 3 5 7 9</values>
      </variable>
    </netcdf>

    <!-- Second slice must match shape! -->
    <netcdf title="Sample Slice 2">
      <dimension name="station" length="5"/>
      <variable name="V" type="int" shape="station">
    <values>2 4 6 8 10</values>
      </variable>
    </netcdf>

  </aggregation>

<!-- This is what the expected output aggregation will look like.
       We can use the named dimensions for the shape here since the aggregation
       comes first and the dimensions will be added to the parent dataset by now -->
  <variable name="V_expected" type="int" shape="day station">
    <!-- Row major values.  Since we create a new outer dimension, the slices are concatenated
        since the outer dimension varies the slowest in row major order.  This gives a 2x5 Array.
     We use the newline to show the dimension separation for the reader's benefit -->
    <values>
      1 3 5 7 9 
      2 4 6 8 10
    </values>
  </variable>

</netcdf>
----

Notice that we specify the name of the aggregation variable *V* inside the
aggregation using a <variableAgg> element --- this allows to to specify
multiple variables in the datasets to join. The new dimension, however,
is specified by the attribute _dimName_ of <aggregation>. We do NOT need
to specify a <dimension> element for the new dimension (in fact, it
would be an error to do so). Its size is calculated based on the number
of datasets in the aggregation.

Running this file through the module produces the following DDS:

----
Dataset {
    Int32 V[day = 2][station = 5];
    Int32 V_expected[day = 2][station = 5];
    String day[day = 2];
} joinNew_virtual.ncml;
----

Notice how the new dimension caused a _coordinate variable_ to be
created with the same name and shape as the new dimension. This array
will contain the default values for the new outer dimension's map as we
shall see if we ask for the ASCII version of the DODS (data) response:

----
The data:
Int32 V[day = 2][station = 5] = {{1, 3, 5, 7, 9},{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}};
Int32 V_expected[day = 2][station = 5] = {{1, 3, 5, 7, 9},{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}};
String day[day = 2] = {"Virtual_Dataset_0", "Virtual_Dataset_1"};
----

We see that the resulting aggregation data matches what we expected to
create, specified by our *V_expected* variable. Also, notice that the
values for the coordinate variable are "Virtual_Dataset_i", where i is
the number of the dataset. Since the datasets did not have the
_location_ attribute set (which would have been used if it was), the
module generates unique names for the virtual datasets in the output.

We could also have specified the value for the dataset using the
_netcdf@coordValue_ attribute:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<netcdf title="Sample joinNew Aggregation on Pure NCML Datasets">
  
    <aggregation type="joinNew" dimName="day">
    <variableAgg name="V"/>

    <netcdf title="Sample Slice 1" coordValue="100">
      <dimension name="station" length="5"/>
      <variable name="V" type="int" shape="station">
    <values>1 3 5 7 9</values>
      </variable>
    </netcdf>

    <netcdf title="Sample Slice 2" coordValue="107">
      <dimension name="station" length="5"/>
      <variable name="V" type="int" shape="station">
    <values>2 4 6 8 10</values>
      </variable>
    </netcdf>

  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
----

This results in the ASCII DODS of...

----
The data:
Int32 V[day = 2][station = 5] = {{1, 3, 5, 7, 9},{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}};
Float64 day[day = 2] = {100, 107};
----

Since the coordValue's could be parsed numerically, the coordinate
variable is of type double (Float64). If they could not be parsed
numerically, then the variable would be of type String.

Now that the reader has an idea of the basics of the joinNew
aggregation, we will create examples for the many different use cases
the NcML aggregation author may wish to create.

== A Simple Example Using Explicit Dataset Files

Using virtual datasets is not that common. More commonly, the
aggregation author wants to specify files for the aggregation. As an
introductory example of this, we'll create a simple aggregation
explicitly listing the files and giving string coordValue's. Note that
this is a contrived example: we are using the same dataset file for each
member, but changing the coordValue's. Also notice that we have
specified that _both_ the *u* and *v* variables be aggregated using the
same new dimension name __source__.

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<netcdf title="joinNew Aggregation with explicit string coordValue.">
  
  <aggregation type="joinNew" dimName="source">    
    <variableAgg name="u"/>
    <variableAgg name="v"/>

    <!-- Same dataset a few times, but with different coordVal -->
    <netcdf title="Dataset 1" location="data/ncml/fnoc1.nc" coordValue="Station_1"/>
    <netcdf title="Dataset 2" location="data/ncml/fnoc1.nc" coordValue="Station_2"/>
    <netcdf title="Dataset 3" location="data/ncml/fnoc1.nc" coordValue="Station_3"/>

  </aggregation>

</netcdf>
----

...which produces the DDS:

----
Dataset {
    Int16 u[source = 3][time_a = 16][lat = 17][lon = 21];
    Int16 v[source = 3][time_a = 16][lat = 17][lon = 21];
    Float32 lat[lat = 17];
    Float32 lon[lon = 21];
    Float32 time[time = 16];
    String source[source = 3];
} joinNew_string_coordVal.ncml;
----

Since there's so much data we only show the new coordinate variable:

----
String source[source = 3] = {"Station_1", "Station_2", "Station_3"};
----

Also notice that other coordinate variables (lat, lon, time) already
existed in the datasets along with the *u* and *v* arrays. Any variable
that is not aggregated over (specified as an aggregationVar) is
explicitly _union_ aggregated (please see
<<union_aggregation, NCML_Module_Aggregation_Union>>
into the resulting dataset --- the first instance of every variable
found in the order the datasets are listed is used.

Now that we've seen simple cases, let's look at more complex examples.

== Examples of Explicit Dataset Listings

In this section we will give several examples of joinNew aggregation
with a static, explicit list of member datasets. In particular, we will
go over examples of...

* Default values for the new coordinate variable
* Explicitly setting values of any type on the new coordinate variable
* Autogenerating uniform numeric values for the new coordinate variable
* Explicitly setting String or double values using the
_netcdf@coordValue_ attribute

There are several ways to specify values for the new coordinate variable
of the new outer dimension. If String or double values are sufficient,
the author may set the value for each listed dataset using the
_netcdf@coordValue_ attribute for each dataset. If another type is
required for the new coordinate variable, then the author has a choice
of specifying the entire new coordinate variable explicitly (which must
match dimensionality of the aggregated dimension) or using the
start/increment autogeneration <values> element for numeric, evenly
spaced samples.

Please see the <<join_new_tutorial, Join Explicit Dataset Tutorial>>.

== Adding/Modifying Metadata on Aggregations

It is possible to add or modify metadata on existing or new variables in
an aggregation. The syntax for these varies somewhat, so we give
examples of the different cases. We will also give examples of providing metadata:

* Adding/modifying metadata to the new coordinate variable
* Adding/modifying metadata to the aggregation variable itself
* Adding/modifying metadata to existing maps in an aggregated Grid

<<metdata_tutorial, Metadata on Aggregations Tutorial>>.

== Dynamic Aggregations Using Directory Scanning

A powerful way to create dynamic aggregations (rather than by listing
datasets explicitly) is by specifying a data directory where aggregation
member datasets are stored and some criteria for which files are to be
added to the aggregation. These criteria will be combined in a
conjunction (an AND operator) to handle various types of searches. The
way to specify datasets in an aggregation is by using the <scan> element
inside the <aggregation> element.

A key benefit of using the <scan> element is that the NcML file need not
change as new datasets are added to the aggregation, say by an automated
process which simply writes new data files into a specific directory. By
properly specifying the NcML aggregation with a scan, the same NcML will
refer to a dynamically changing aggregation, staying up to date with
current data, without the need for modifications to the NcML file
itself. If the filenames have a timestamp encoded in them, the use of
the dateFormatMark allows for automatic creation of the new coordinate
variable data values as well, as shown below.

The scan element may be used to search a directory to find files that
match the following criteria:

* **Suffix** : the aggregated files end in a specific suffix, indicating
the file type
* **Subdirectories**: any subdirectories of the given location are to be
searched and all regular files tested against the criteria
* **Older Than**: the aggregated files must have been modified longer
than some duration ago (to exclude files that may be currently being
written)
* **Reg Exp**: the aggregated file pathnames must match a specific
regular expression
* **Date Format Mark**: this highly useful criterion, useful in
conjunction with others, allows the specification of a pattern in the
filename which encodes a timestamp. The timestamp is extracted from the
filenames using the pattern and is used to create
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] date elements for the
new dimension's coordinate variable.

We will give examples of each of these criteria in use in our tutorial.
Again, if more than one is specified, then ALL must match for the file
to be included in the aggregation.
