== Introduction

A _joinExisting_ aggregation joins multiple granule datasets by
concatenating the specified outer dimensional data from the granules
into the output. This results in matrices of the same number of
dimensions, but with larger outer dimension cardinality. The outer
dimension sizes of the granules may vary across granule, but any inner
dimensions for multi-dimensional data still are required to match.

The reader is also directed to a basic tutorial of this NcML aggregation
which may be found at
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/v2.2/Aggregation.html#joinExisting.
Note that version 1.1.0 of the module does not support all features of
joinExisting.

== Content Summary

This section describes the behavior of the initial implementation of
joinExisting for version 1.2.x of the NcML Module, bundled with Hyrax
1.8. It is a limited feature set described below. Please see the
Limitations section for more information.

In version 1.2.x, a joinExisting aggregation may be specified in three
ways:

* Using explicit lists of *netcdf* elements with the the _ncoords_
attribute correctly specified for all of them.
* Leaving off the _ncoords_ attribute for all of the _netcdf_ elements.
* Using a *scan* element with _ncoords_ specified and all matching
granule datasets having this dimension size

Our example below will clarify this.

Future versions of the module will implement more of the joinExisting
feature set.

== Examples

Here we give an example that illustrates the functionality offered by
the current version of the aggregation. This example may also be found
on...

...with the data granules located in

== Granules

Assume we have some number of granule datasets with a DDS the same as
the following (modulo the dataset name):

----
Dataset {
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 PHssta[time = 1][altitude = 1][lat = 4096][lon = 8192];
      Maps:
        Float64 time[time = 1];
        Float64 altitude[altitude = 1];
        Float64 lat[lat = 4096];
        Float64 lon[lon = 8192];
    } PHssta;
} PH2006001_2006031_ssta.nc;
----

== Explicit Listing of Granules

We see that here _time_ is the outer dimension, which is the only
dimension we may join along (it is an error to specify an inner). Given
some number of granules with this same shape, consider the following
explicit joinExisting aggregation:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<netcdf title="joinExisting test on netcdf Grid granules">
 
  <aggregation type="joinExisting" dimName="time" >
    <!-- Note explicit use of ncoords specifying size of "time" -->
    <netcdf location="/coverage/mday/PH2006001_2006031_ssta.nc" ncoords="1"/>
    <netcdf location="/coverage/mday/PH2006032_2006059_ssta.nc" ncoords="1"/>
    <netcdf location="/coverage/mday/PH2006060_2006090_ssta.nc" ncoords="1"/>
  </aggregation>
 
</netcdf>
----

Here's the same aggregation using the _scan_ element instead of
explicitly listing each file:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<netcdf title="joinExisting test on netcdf Grid granules using scan">
 
  <aggregation type="joinExisting" dimName="time" >
    <scan location="/coverage/mday/" suffix=".nc"/>
  </aggregation>
 
</netcdf>
----

First, note that the _ncoords_ attribute should be specified on the
individual granules for this version of the module. In many cases the
handler will be more efficient if the _ncoords_ attribute is used. Note
that we also specify the __dimName__. Any data array whose outer
dimension is called this will be subject to aggregation in the output.

Serving this from Hyrax will result in the following DDS:

----
Dataset {
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 PHssta[time = 3][altitude = 1][lat = 4096][lon = 8192];
      Maps:
        Float64 time[time = 3];
        Float64 altitude[altitude = 1];
        Float64 lat[lat = 4096];
        Float64 lon[lon = 8192];
    } PHssta;
    Float64 time[time = 3];
} mday_joinExist.ncml;
----

We see that the time dimension is now of size 3 to match that we joined
three granule datasets together.

Also notice that the map vector for the joined dimension, time, has been
duplicated as a sibling of the dataset. This is done automatically by
the aggregation and it is copied into the actual map of the Grid. This
copy is to facilitate datasets which have multiple Grid's that are to be
joined --- the top-level map vector is used as the canonical template
map which is then copied into the maps for all the aggregated Grids. In
the case of the joined data being of type Array, this vector would
already exist as the coordinate variable for the data matrix. Since this
is the source map for all aggregated Grid's, any attribute (metadata)
changes should be made explicitly on this top-level coordinate variable
so that the metadata is shared among all the aggregated Grid map
vectors.

== Using the Scan Element

The collection of member datasets in a joinExisiting aggregation can be
specified using the NcML _scan_ element as described in the
<<dynamic_aggregation_tutorial, dynamic aggregation tutorial>>.

=== NcML Dimension Cache

If the scan element is used without the _ncoords_ extension (see below),
then the first time a joinExisiting aggregation is accessed (say by
requesting it's DDS) the *BES process will open every file* in the
aggregation and cache its dimension information in the NcML dimension
cache. By default the cache files are written into `/tmp` and the total
size of the cache is limited to a maximum size of 2GB. These settings
can be changed by modifying the `ncml.conf file`, typically located in
`/etc/bes/modules/ncml.conf`:

----
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#
# NcML Aggregation Dimension Cache Parameters                           #
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#
 
# Directory into which the cache files will be stored.
NCML.DimensionCache.directory=/tmp
 
# Filename prefix to be used for the cache files
NCML.DimensionCache.prefix=ncml_dimension_cache
 
# This is the size of the cache in megabytes; e.g., 2,000 is a 2GB cache
NCML.DimensionCache.size=2000
 
# Maximum number of dimension allowed in any particular dataset. 
# If not set in this configuration the value defaults to 100.
# NCML.DimensionCache.maxDimensions=100
----

The cache files are small compared to the source dataset files,
typically less than 1kb for a dataset with a few named dimensions.
However, the cache files are numerous, one for each file used in a
joinExisiting aggregation. If you have large joinExisiting aggregations,
it is important to be sure that the *NCML.DimensionCache.directory* has
space to contain the cache and that the *NCML.DimensionCache.size* to an
appropriately large value.

Because the first access of the aggregation triggers the population of
the NcML dimension cache for that aggregation the time for this first
access can be significant. It may be that typical HTTP clients will
timeout before that requests completes. If a client timeout occurs
dimension cache may not get fully populated, however subsequent requests
will cause the cache population to pick up where it was left off.

With only a modicum of effort one could write a shell program that
utilizes the BES standalone functionality to pre-populate the dimension
caches for large joinExisiting aggregations.

=== ncoords Extension

If all of the granules are of uniform dimensional size, we may also use
the syntactic sugar provided by a Hyrax-specific extension to NcML --
adding the _ncoords_ attribute to a *scan* element. The behavior of this
extension is to set the _ncoords_ for each granule matching the scan to
be this value, as if the datasets were each listed explicitly with this
value of the attribute. Here's an example of using the syntactic sugar
that results in the same exact aggregation as the previous explicit one:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- joinExisting test on netcdf granules using scan@ncoords extension-->
<netcdf title="joinExisting test on netcdf Grid granules using scan@ncoords"
    >
  
  <attribute name="Description" type="string"
         value=" joinExisting test on netcdf Grid granules using scan@ncoords"/>

  <aggregation type="joinExisting" 
           dimName="time" >

    <!-- Filenames have lexicographic and chronological ordering match -->
    <scan location="/coverage/mday"
      subdirs="false"
      suffix=".nc"
      ncoords="1"
      />

  </aggregation>
  
</netcdf>
----

...which we see results in the same DDS:

----
Dataset {
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 PHssta[time = 3][altitude = 1][lat = 4096][lon = 8192];
      Maps:
        Float64 time[time = 3];
        Float64 altitude[altitude = 1];
        Float64 lat[lat = 4096];
        Float64 lon[lon = 8192];
    } PHssta;
    Float64 time[time = 3];
} mday_joinExist.ncml;
----

The advantage of this is that the server does not have to inspect all of
the member granules to determine their dimensional size, which allows
server to manufacture responses much more quickly.

== Limitations

The current version implements only basic functionality. If there is
extended functionality that is needed for your use, please send
<mailto:support@opendap.org[mailto:support@opendap.org]> to let us know!

=== Join Dimension Sizes Should Be Explicitly Declared

As we have seen, the most important limitation to the JoinExisting
aggregation support is that the _ncoords_ attribute should be specified
for efficiency reasons. Future versions will continue to relax this
requirement. The problem is that the size of the output join dimension
is dependent on checking the DDS of _every_ granule in the aggregation,
which is computationally expensive for large aggregations.

=== Source of Data for Aggregated Coordinate Variable on Join Dimension

This version does not allow the join dimension's data to be declared
explicitly in the NcML as the NcML tutorial page describes. This version
automatically aggregates *all* variables with the outer dimension
matching the __dimName__. This includes the coordinate variable (map
vector in the case of Grid's) for the join dimension. These data cannot
be overridden from those pulled from the files. Currently the TDS lists
about 5 ways this data can be specified in addition to pulling them from
the granules --- we only can pull them from granules now, which seems
the most common use.

=== Source of Join Dimension Metadata

The metadata for the coordinate variable is pulled from the _first_
granule dataset. Modification of coordinate variable metadata is not
fully supported yet.
