== Overview ==
Many users access DAP servers using a browser as their primary software interface. However there is also a growing group of users that utilize either:
* A "smart" tool. Where "smart" means that the tool understands how to interact with a DAP service and construct DAP queries for data and use that in higher level  client side activities like GUI based graphs, image display, selection, navigation etc.
* A command line tool such as "wget" or "curl" that can be used to extract data from a DAP service, but the URL construction is left to other software.
In both these examples we want these client software applications to be able to manage authentication without user intervention, otherwise the automation benefits of these tools is lost.

=== Earthdata Login Users

Earthdata Login is a NASA run Single Sign-On service. In order to access NASA held data you will need to:

1. Obtain (for free) your own set of https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new[Earthdata Login credentials]. 
1. _Approve_ the DAP server application that is serving the data you want. as described in the following section.
1. Use this guide to configure your DAP client of choice (_curl_, browser, etc.) to utilize these credentials.

NOTE: _Throughout this document NASA's Earthdata Login is referred to as and is synonymous with *URS* (NASA changed the name of this service shortly before it's use became mandatory for all data access requests.)_

==== Acquire Earthdata Login credentials 
Registering with Earthdata Login and getting a
user account is free. Point you browser at the https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new[Earthdata Login New User] page and do the stuff that needs the doing. 

==== Approving The DAP Server Application 

Regardless of which software client you decide to employ, before you can access any new Earthdata Login authenticated server you must first add that sever to the list of *Approved Applications* in your Earthdata Login profile. 

To do this you will need the Earthdata Login Application name (aka UID) under which the DAP server is registered with Earthdata Login and your Earthdata Login credentials.

* With your browser, navigate to your https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile[Earthdata Login profile page.] 
* Click the *My Applications* tab.

On the *My Applications* page:

* Click the *Approve More Applications* button.
This will display the application search page:

image::UrsApplicationSearch.png[Earthdata Login Approve Applications Page]

* Enter some or all of the name you picked (which became the UID) of your new application and click the *Search For Applications* button, this will bring you to the Earthdata Login Application Approval page:

image::UrsApproveApplication.png[Earthdata Login Application Approval Page]


* Select your new application and click the _Approve Selected Applications_ button.
You will be returned to the *My Applications* page where you should now see your new application on the list of _Approved Applications_.

NOTE: The application named *tesy_tesy* used in this example does not really exist and is for educational puspose only.

== _curl_ (a.k.a. _lib_curl_) ==

=== URS ===

I was able to use command line _curl_ to retrieve URS authenticated  resources using the following technique.

First in my home directory I created a _.netrc_ file and set its file permissions to read only for owner:
----
[spooky:~] ndp% touch .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% chmod 600 .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% ls -l .netrc
-rw-------@ 1 ndp  staff  92 Nov 13 06:08 .netrc
----
Then I edited the _.netrc_ file and associated my URS credentials with the URS IdP instance utilized by my target DAP server:
[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
	login your_urs_uid
	password your_urs_password
----
I could then retrieve a DDS object in the URS authentication enabled Hyrax server with the following _curl_ command: 
----
curl -k -n -c ursCookies -b ursCookies -L --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
----
What is happening here?

-k:: This tells _curl_ to accept self-signed certificates. This is ok for working with trusted (as in your own) "test" services but should be removed for working with production systems. Because: Security, Chain-Of-Trust, etc.

-n:: This tells _curl_ to use that _~/.netrc_ file I created.

-c ursCookies:: This tells _curl_ to stash cookies in the file _ursCookies_

-b ursCookies:: This tells _curl_ to read cookies from the file _ursCookies_

-L:: Also known as _--location_, this option tells _curl_ to follow redirects, which is a must for any OAuth2 flow. 

NOTE: The ``--location-trusted`` option should not be used as it will cause _curl_ to spread user credentials to servers other than to which they were associated._

--url https://54.172.97.47/opendap:: The desired URL, protected by the Earthdata Login authentication flow.

In order to retrieve multiple URLs with out reauthenticating you can use multiple instances of the _--url_ parameter:

----
curl -k -n -c ursCookies -b ursCookies -L --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.dds
----

Or, since _curl_ is actually pretty smart about using cookies and such you can also make multiple _curl_ requests with the same cookies and it won't have to reauthenticate with URS once it's authenticated the first time:

---- 
curl -k -n -c ursCookies -b ursCookies -L --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap
curl -k -n -c ursCookies -b ursCookies -L --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
curl -k -n -c ursCookies -b ursCookies -L --url https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.dds 
----

===LDAP ===

I was able to use command line _curl_ to retrieve LDAP authenticated resources using the following technique.

First in my home directory I created a _.netrc_ file and set its file permissions to read only for owner:

----
[spooky:~] ndp% touch .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% chmod 600 .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% ls -l .netrc
-rw-------@ 1 ndp  staff  92 Nov 13 06:08 .netrc
----

Then I edited the _.netrc_ file and associated my LDAP credentials with the LDAP authenticated DAP server:

----
machine 130.56.244.153
	login tesla
	password password
----

I could then access the top level directory of the LDAP authentication enabled Hyrax server with the following _curl_ command: 

----
curl -k -n -c ldapCookies -b ldapCookies  --url https://130.56.244.153/opendap
----

What is happening here?

-k:: This tells _curl_ to accept self-signed certificates. This is ok for working with trusted (as in your own) "test" services but should be removed for working with production systems. Because: Security, Chain-Of-Trust, etc.
-n:: This tells _curl_ to use that _~/.netrc_ file I created.
-c ldapCookies:: This tells _curl_ to stash cookies in the file _ldapCookies_
-b ldapCookies:: This tells _curl_ to read cookies from the file _ldapCookies_
--url https://130.56.244.153/opendap:: The desired URL, protected LDAP authentication.

Note that the credentials are sent with every request so secure transport is a must if user accounts are to be protected.

=== Shibboleth ===

==== .netrc ====

I was not able to use command line _curl_ to retrieve Shibboleth authentication resources using the _.netrc_ technique described in the LDAP and URS sections. 

Analysis of the HTTP conversation between the idp.testshib.org  server and _curl_ shows that curl correctly follows the series of 302 redirects issued to it, first by the Apache service bound to the Hyrax server and then from the idp.testshib.org server. In every request to the idp.testshib.org server the _curl_ client correctly offers the credentials via the HTTP Authorization header:

----
0000: GET /idp/Authn/UserPassword HTTP/1.1
0026: Authorization: Basic bXlzZWxmOm15c2VsZg==
0051: User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.2
0091: 1.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8z zlib/1.2.5
00b0: Host: idp.testshib.org
00c8: Accept: */*
00d5: Cookie: _idp_authn_lc_key=efbb6e2a9d893b47fb802ed575329ce69c101b
0115: 3ea8beb6744fab64fc406c358f; JSESSIONID=5A1731EDE00613B13803968CF
0155: AF06284
015e: 
----

But the Shibboleth system doesn't respond to them. This may be a simple configuration issue on the Shibboleth end, or it could be that the Shibboleth protocol specifically forbids accepting credentials via HTTP Authorization headers.

==== certificates ====

== _wget_ ==
=== URS ===

The _wget_ documentation indicates that _wget_ understands to use the _.netrc_ file that we created for _curl_, and happily it appears to work, as long as other things are in place.
Consider this _wget_ command:

----
wget  --load-cookies cookies --save-cookies cookies --keep-session-cookie --no-check-certificate https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
----

What's happening here?

--load-cookies cookies :: Load cookies from the file "cookies"
--save-cookies cookies :: Save cookies to the file "cookies"
--keep-session-cookie :: Save session cookies.
--no-check-certificate :: Do not check the authenticity of the (self signed) certificates. This is good for testing against your own servers running with self-signed certificates in that this switch will allow you to experience success when interacting with such servers. However, this switch breaks the *chain of trust* and may allow bad things to happen if used on the open internets. Thus, for regular use, do not include this switch!
https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds:: The URL to retrieve.

Here's the output of said _wget_ request:

----
[spooky:olfs/testsuite/urs] ndp% wget  --load-cookies cookies --save-cookies cookies --keep-session-cookie --no-check-certificate https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds

It appears that _wget_ correctly followed the first redirect to ``uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov``, where the URS server responded with a "401 Unauthorized" (thanks to the the app_type=401 query parameter in the redirect URL provided by mod_auth_urs). After getting the 401 _wget_ resubmits the request with the authentication credentials and the URS server accepts them and redirects _wget_ back to the _mod_auth_urs_ server to complete the request.

=== Shibboleth ===

== _ncdump_ ==
ncdump utilizes the NetCDF-C library to access DAP resources so ncdump is a litmus test for any command line application that uses the netCDF C library. Because the netCDF C library is the software component that is performing the authentication, the configuration steps outlined here should directly translate to any application that uses netCDF C. Note, however, that these steps were tested against the version of netCDF C retrieved from GitHub on 1 May 2105. That software likely corresponds to netCDF version 4.3.3.1 or later. Contact Unidata for the latest information.

=== Earth Data Login (URS)  ===

The following works with the ncdump (and oc client) code bundled with NetCDF-4.3.3.1 Previous versions including 4.3.2 and 4.3.1 will not work.

Edit (create as needed) the file _.netrc_ in your HOME directory, and set its file permissions to read only for owner:

----
[spooky:~] ndp% touch .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% chmod 600 .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% ls -l . netrc
-rw-------@ 1 ndp  staff  92 Nov 13 06:08 . netrc
----

Add your Earth Data Login credentials to the _.netrc_ file, associating them with the Earth Data Login server that you normally authenticate with, like this:

[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
	login your_urs_uid
	password you_urs_password
----

Next, edit the _.dodsrc_ file in your HOME directory so that it tells DAP clients to use the _.netrc_ file for password information:
[source,apache]
----
HTTP.COOKIEJAR=/Users/jimg/.cookies
HTTP.NETRC=/Users/jimg/.netrc
----

Here is a typical _.dodsrc_ file.
[source,apache]
----
# OPeNDAP client configuration file. See the OPeNDAP
# users guide for information.
USE_CACHE=0
# Cache and object size are given in megabytes (20 ==> 20Mb).
MAX_CACHE_SIZE=20
MAX_CACHED_OBJ=5
IGNORE_EXPIRES=0

HTTP.NETRC=/Users/jimg/.netrc
----

=== LDAP ===
To configure ncdump (and thus just about every client application that uses netCDF C) for LDAP-back HTTP/S-Basic authentication, follow the same exact procedure as outline above for URS, except that in the _.netrc_ file, use the OpenDAP server's machine name or IP number in place of the URS authentication site. Here's a summary, with an example:

Edit (create as needed) the file _.netrc_ in your HOME directory, and set its file permissions to read only for owner:


----
[spooky:~] ndp% touch .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% chmod 600 .netrc
[spooky:~] ndp% ls -l . netrc
-rw-------@ 1 ndp  staff  92 Nov 13 06:08 . netrc
----

Add your LDAP credentials to the _.netrc_ file, associating them with the DAP server that you want to access, like this:

[source,apache]
----
machine opendap.server.using.ldap
	login your_ldap_login_name
	password your_ldap_password
----

Next, edit the _.dodsrc_ file in your HOME directory so that it tells DAP clients to use the _.netrc_ file for password information:
[source,apache]
----
HTTP.COOKIEJAR=/Users/jimg/.cookies
HTTP.NETRC=/Users/jimg/.netrc
----

=== Shibboleth ===

At the time of this writing the _ncdump_ application and the NetCDF library do not support authentication using the Shibboleth ECP profile.

== _Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)_ ==

The Integrated Data Viewer is GUI driven data client that is based around the CDM/NetCDF data model and utilizes that NetCDF-Java (and thus the Java DAP implementation) to access remote DAP datasets. Because it has a GUI it can retrieve (and cache for later) users credentials directly from the user.
Since IDV utilizes the Java-NetCDF library to access DAP resources then in theory if it works for IDV then it should work for all the other clients that use the Java-NetCDF library.

I http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/current/index.jsp[downloaded the latest version of IDV] (5.0u2 on 11/19/14) and installed it on my local system.

=== URS ===

For URS testing I utilized my AWS test service, configured to require URS authentication for all access of Hyrax.

In IDV I attempted to choose a new dataset by starting with the "Data" menu: Data > Choose Data > From A Web Server 

In the resulting pane I entered the AWS test service URL for our friend _coads_climatology.nc_:

https://54.172.97.47/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When I committed the edit (aka hit Enter) IDV popped up a dialog box that indicated that the _uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov_ server wanted my credentials:

image::IDVAuthDialog.png[IDV URS Authentication Dialog]

I entered them, clicked the save password check box, and clicked the _OK_ button. IDV was then able to access the requested resource. After the first successful access other resources at the AWS server were also available, but without an additional authentication challenge being presented to the user.

=== LDAP ===

For testing I utilized an ANU/NCI puppet instance configured to require LDAP authentication for all access of Hyrax.

In IDV I attempted to choose a new dataset by starting with the "Data" menu: Data > Choose Data > From A Web Server 

In the resulting pane I entered the AWS test service URL for our friend _coads_climatology.nc_:

https://130.56.244.153/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When I committed the edit (aka hit Enter) IDV popped up a dialog box that indicated that the _130.56.244.153_ server wanted my credentials:

image::IDV-LDAP.png[IDV LDAP Authentication Dialog]

I entered them, clicked the save password check box, and clicked the _OK_ button. IDV was then able to access the requested resource. 

=== Shibboleth ===
_Summary: Failed To Authenticate_

For Shibboleth testing I utilized an AWS VM, configured to require Shibboleth authentication for all access of Hyrax.

In IDV I attempted to choose a new dataset by starting with the "Data" menu: Data > Choose Data > From A Web Server 

In the resulting pane I entered the AWS VM service URL for our friend _coads_climatology.nc_:

https://54.174.13.127/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When I committed the edit (aka hit Enter) IDV popped up a dialog box that indicated that there was an error loading the data:

== _ToolsUI_ ==

The ToolsUI application is a simple is GUI driven data client that is based around the CDM/NetCDF data model and utilizes that NetCDF-Java (and thus the Java DAP implementation) to access remote DAP datasets. Because it has a GUI it can retrieve (and cache for later) users credentials directly from the user.

I ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/v4.5/toolsUI-4.5.jar[downloaded the latest version of ToolsUI] (4.5 on 11/19/14) and installed it on my local system. I launched ToolsUI using the command line:

https://130.56.244.153/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When I committed the edit (aka hit Enter) Panoply popped up a dialog box that indicated that there was an error loading the data:

== Matlab, Ferret, Other applications that use NetCDF C ==
Check the version of the netCDF C library that the application uses; once they have updated to 4.3.3.1 or later, authentication configuration should be the same as the _ncdump_ example above. That is, both URS and LDAP-backed HTTP/S-Basic authentication should work by reading credentials from the _.netrc_ file given that the _.dodsrc_ file is set to point to them.

=== URS & LDAP ===
Here's a short summary of the configuration 
Add your URS/LDAP credentials to the _.netrc_ file, associating them with the URS/OpenDAP server that you normally authenticate with, like this:

[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
login your_earthdata_login_user_name
password your_earthdata_login_password

machine opendap.server.using.ldap
	login your_ldap_login_name
	password your_ldap_password
----

Next, edit the _.dodsrc_ file in your HOME directory so that it tells DAP clients to use the _.netrc_ file for password information:

[source,apache]
----
HTTP.COOKIEJAR=/Users/jimg/.cookies
HTTP.NETRC=/Users/jimg/.netrc
----

=== Shibboleth ===
This is certain to not work until the netCDF C library is modified to explicitly support it.

== PyDAP ==
The PyDAP software (pydap.org) provides one interface for python programs to read from OpenDAP servers (the other is the netCDF4 python module, which uses the netCDF-C library to actually access data, include data from OpenDAP servers). PyDAP includes an extension mechanism so that it can interact with different kinds of authentication systems. This system is very flexible and we were able to use it to add support for both LDAP-backed HTTP/S Basic authentication and ELA/URS. The same scheme could be used to add support for Shibboleth, although it would take additional development work (described in general below).

=== URS & LDAP ===
To use PyDAP with a server the requires either LDAP or ELA/URS authentication, first enter host, username and password credentials in the .netrc file stored in your home account. If it does not yet exist, make a file using a text editor. The format of this file is the following set of three lines repeated for each host:

[source,apache]
----
machine server.that.accepts.credentials
	login your_login_name
	password your_password
----

NOTE: For LDAP-backed HTTP/S Basic authentication, each host that might prompt for credentials must be listed (and the username and password repeated, even if it is the same for several hosts). For ELA/URS, list only the ELA/URS site and the username and password you use for it.

Here's an example _.netrc_ file: 

[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
login jhrg
password ****

machine uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
login jhrg
password ****

machine 130.56.244.153
login tesla
password password
----

Once the _.netrc_ file is configured, start python, run the function install_basic_client() and then access servers. Here's a python script that will open a PyDAP virtual connection to an authenticated server:

[source,python]
----
# Set up PyDAP to use the URS request() function

from pydap.util.urs import install_basic_client
install_basic_client()
from pydap.client import open_url
d = open_url('https://52.1.74.222/opendap/data/hdf4/S3096277.HDF')
----

=== Shibboleth ===
This will require a new patch function, similar to _install_basic_client()_ be written. It will be a bit more complex because of the increased complexity of Shibboleth, but the operation for end-users will likely be the same.
