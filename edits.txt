Replace all the '_-_' sequences in the files with plain '_' using:

sed -e 's/_-_/_/g' -i .sav *.adoc

Rename the files in the dir using (will gripe about moving a dir onto
itself, ignore):

for f in *.adoc; do echo $f;  new=`echo $f | sed 's/_-_/_/g'`;
echo $new;  git mv $f $new; done

Repeat for 'Master-' to 'Master_' This only needs to be done in the
main directory
