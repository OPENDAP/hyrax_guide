== Overview ==
Installing a Hyrax binary release typically involves the following:

* https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server[Download the
  latest Hyrax release] usually composed of:
** 2 RPM files (one for _libdap_, one for the _BES_).
** The OLFS binary distribution file.
* Install the _libdap_ RPM.
* Install the _BES_ RPM.
* Unpack the OLFS distribution file, and install the _opendap.war_
  file into your Tomcat instance's _webapps_ directory.

TIP: The detailed download and installation instructions for Hyrax are
published on the download page for each release of the server. Find
the latest release and its associated installation details on
https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server[the Hyrax downloads

== WCS Installation

The WCS 2 service comes bundled as part of Hyrax-1.14.0 and newer.
For more information about configuring WCS with your installation of Hyrax,
please refer to the <<WCS_installation_guide, WCS Installation Guide>> that
appears later in this document.

== Source Code Builds

If you are interested in working on Hyrax or want to build the
server from source code (as opposed to using the prebuilt binaries that we
provide), you can get signed source distributions from the
https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server[download page]
referenced above. See also the <<for-developers, For Software Developers>>
section below.
