== Introduction

This document describes the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler, which can
be used with the OPeNDAP data server. It is not a complete description
of the FreeForm ND software. For that, please refer to the ND manual.

This document contains much material originally written at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Environmental
Satellite, Data, and Information Service, which is part of the National
Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.

We are interested in your comments about the OPeNDAP software, and the
FreeForm ND software and this document. Send them to:
support@opendap.org.

Using FreeForm ND with OPeNDAP, a researcher can easily make his or her
data available to the wider community of OPeNDAP users without having to
convert that data into another data file format. This document presents
the FreeForm ND software, and shows how to use it with the OPeNDAP
server.

=== Tasks Illustrated in this Section

For a quick start to using the FreeForm ND software, see the list below
of tasks described in this document.

* Quick start. (link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/dquick[here])
* Serving tabular data. (link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/tblfmt[here])
* Array tabular data. (link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/arrayfmt[here])
* Dealing with data file headers
(link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/hdrfmts[here])
* Setup of File servers (link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/fileserv[here])

==== Serving Data with Timestamps in the File Names

This handler can read data stored in files that incorporate data strings
in their names. This feature was added to support serving data produced
and hosted by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and while the run-time
parameters bear the name of that organization, they can be used for any
data that fit the naming conventions they have developed. The naming
convention is as follows:

The convention::
  + '_' + <date_string> + <version> + [_d3d]
Daily data::
  When <date_string> includes YYYYMMDDVV, the file contains _daily_
  data.
Averaged data::
  When <date_string> only includes YYYYMMVV (no __DD__), or includes
  (__DD__) and optional __d3d_ then the file contains _averaged_ data.

For _daily_ data the format file should be named _<data
source>_daily.fmt_ while averaged data should be named __<data
source>_averaged.fmt__.

To use this feature, set the run-time parameter _FF.RSSFormatSupport_ to
_yes_ or __true__. If you store the format files (and optional ancillary
DAS files) in a directory other than the data, use the parameter
_FF.RSSFormatFiles_ to name that other directory. Like all handler
run-time configuration parameters, these can go in either the _bes.conf_
or _ff.conf_ file. Here's an example sniplet from ff.conf showing how
these are used:

----
# 
# Data Handler Specific key/value parameters
#
FF.RSSFormatSupport = yes
FF.RSSFormatFiles = /usr/local/RSS

=== Who is this Guide for?

This guide is for people who wish to use FreeForm ND to serve scientific
datasets using the OPeNDAP software. Scientists who wish to share their
data with colleagues may also find this a useful system, since it is a
relatively simple matter to set up a server that can allow remote access
to your data.

This documentation assumes that the readers are familiar with computers
and the internet, but are not necessarily programmers. More than a
passing familiarity with different data file formats will be useful, as
will an understanding of elementary internet concepts, such as URLs and
http.

This manual also assumes some familiarity with the OPeNDAP software. If
you are starting from scratch, knowing nothing at all about OPeNDAP, we
strongly encourage you to browse the
link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/OpeNDAP_User%27s_Guide[The OPeNDAP User
Guide] before reading too far here.

=== Organization of this Document

This book contains both introductory and reference material. There is
also a description of the installation procedure.

A position box is often used in this book to indicate column position
of field values in data files. It is shown at the beginning of a data
list in the documentation, but does not appear in the data file itself.
It looks something like this:

----
