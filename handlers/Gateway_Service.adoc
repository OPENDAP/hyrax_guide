== Gateway Service Overview

The Gateway Service provides Hyrax with the ability to apply DAP
constraint expressions and server side functions to data available
through any network URL. This is accomplished by encoding the data
source URL into the DAP request URL supplied to the gateway_service. The
Gateway Service decodes the URL and uses the BES to to retrieve the
remote data resource and transmit the appropriate DAP response back to
the client. The system employs a white list to control what data systems
the BES will access.

NOTE: Rewrite this to explain that we are providing a kind of 'URL
enveloping' scheme. If we are still actually using this. jhrg 9/19/17

A Data Service Portal (DSP), such as Mirador will:

* Provide the navigation/search/discovery interface to the data source.
* Generate the data source URLs.
* Encode the data source URLs.
* Build a regular DAP query as the DAP dataset ID.
* Hand this to the client (via a link or what have you in the DSP
interface)

=== BES Gateway Module

The Gateway Module handles the gathering of the remote data resource and
the construction of the DAP response.

The Gateway Module:

* Evaluates the data source URL against a white list to access
permission
* Retrieves remote data source
* Determines data type by:
** Data type information supplied by the other parts of the server
** HTTP Content-Disposition header
** Applying the BES.TypeMatch string to the last term in the path
section of the data source URL.

The BES will *not* persist the data resources beyond the scope of each
request.

=== OLFS Gateway Service

The Gateway Service is responsible for:

* Decoding the incoming dataset URLs.
* Building the request for the BES.
* Returning the response from the BES to the client.

=== Encoding Data Source URLs

The data source URLs need to be encoded in the DAP data request URL that
is used to access the Gateway Service.

There are many ways to encode something in this context.

==== Prototype Encoding

As a prototype encoding we'll use an hex ascii encoding. In this
encoding each character in the data source URL is expressed as is
hexadecimal value using ascii characters.

Here is
http://www.opendap.org/pub/gateway_service/hexEncoder.tgz[hexEncoder.tgz]
(http://www.opendap.org/pub/gateway_service/hexEncoder.tgz.sig[sig]), a
gzipped tar file containing a java application can perform the encoding
and decoding duties from the command line. Give it a whirl - it's a java
application in a jar file. There is a bash script (hexEncode) that
should launch it.

The source code for the EncodeDecode java class used by hexEncode is
available here:

// I think this example is pretty broken, lets fix this.
