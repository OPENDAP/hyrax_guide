Often it is desirable to treat a collection of data files as if they were
a single dataset. Hyrax provides two different ways to do this: it enables
data providers to define _aggregations_ of files so those appear as a single
dataset and it provides a way for users to send the server a list of files
along with processing operations and receive a single amalgamated response.

In the first half of this appendix, we discuss aggregations defined by
data providers. These aggregations use a simple mark-up language
called NCML, first defined by Unidata as a way to work with NetCDF
files. Both Hyrax and the THREDDS Data Server use NCML as a tool to
describe how data files can be combined to aggregated data sets. In
the second part of this appendix, we discuss user-specified
aggregations. These aggregations currently use a new interface to the
Hyrax server.
