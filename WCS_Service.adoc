== Overview

Hyrax includes an optional WCS-2 service (spcificlly version 2.0.1)
that can be used to access all of the geo-referenced data available to
the server that meet the requirements of the WCS 2 specification. This
appendix describes the the kinds of data that meet these requirements
along with the configuration process of the bundled WCS service.

== Theory of Operation

The WCS utilizes a DAP server (e.g., Hyrax) to supply both coverage
metadata and binary data in response to WCS client requests. In this
operational model, each DAP dataset is considered a (potential) WCS
coverage and the variables within a dataset are (potential) WCS
coverage Field entities.

The WCS service attempts to dynamically map DAP datasets to WCS
coverages so that the data provider need not learn all of the details
of the WCS specifications. All the data provider will need to provide
is a simple template for each set of related datasets and coverages.
The amount of detail required in a template is a function of the
metadata available within a specific datatset. The template, called a
_DynamicService_ definition, must provide the domain coordinate
details (Latitdue, Longitude, etc.) for a group of coverages and,
depending on available metadata, may also need to provide the
field/variable definitions. The template uses a regular expression to
create the association between the _DynamicService_ definition and
files in the DAP server.

=== WCS Definitions

//We should probably provide a link here. -ACP
WARNING: Hack definitions. Look at the *OGC abstract documents* for a
more comprehensive set of definitions.

* *Coverage:* A mapping between a _domain_ and a _range_. This might
sound familiar if you remember your first algebra class, because it is
the definition of a function. A _coverage_ is a special case, because
the _domain_ is often limited to a specific geographic area defined by
a range of latitude and longitude values.

* *Domain Coordinate:* In a _coverage_, a variable that provides the
values for the coverage's domain. For example, the variable that
provides the latitude values.

* *Spatial Reference System (SRS):* The SRS's axes define the _domain_ of
the coverage, which are typically latitude and longitude. The SRS also
provides geo-referencing information that enables analysis tools to
account for irregularities in the Earth's geoid.
_Coordinate Reference System (CRS)_ is synonymous with this term.

== WCS Versions Supported

The Open Geospatial Consortium
(link:http://www.opengeospatial.org/[OGC]) has developed the Web
Coverage Service (WCS) as an open specification, and there is a suite
of standards documents that describe different aspects of the service.
Hyrax supports several of these standards beyond the basic WCS 2.0
core specification.

TIP: The _Open Geospatial Consortium_ has many documents that describe
the concept of a _coverage_ and the different features of WCS. The
link:http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs[suite of
specifications that describe WCS] can be found on their website.

The WCS service bundled with Hyrax 1.14 supports the following WCS
specifications:

* WCS Core Interface Core, version 2.0.1
* Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS), version 1.0.1
* Range Subsetting, version 1.0.0
* KVP Protocol Binding, version 1.0.1

* GeoTIFF Coverage Encoding Profile, version 1.0.1
* JPEG2000 Coverage Encoding Profile, version 1.0.0
* CF-netCDF 3.0 encoding using GML Coverage Application Schema,
  version 2.0

We have partial implementations for:

* XML/POST protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.0
* XML/SOAP Protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.0
* Scaling Extension, version 1.0.0
* CRS Extension, version 1.0.0

If you are interested in the _Earth Observation Application Profile_,
version 1.0.0, <<contact-us, contact us>>.

== Candidate Datasets

In order for the WCS service to work with a dataset served using DAP,
that dataset must contain one or more _coverages_. The dataset
variables must meet the WCS requirements for both structure and
metadata. To qualify as a _coverage_, a variable in a dataset must meet
the following criteria:

* The variable must have an associated _Spatial Reference System_
  (SRS) that describes the organization of latitude and longitude for
  the variable.
  
* The variable must be a numeric array of at least two dimentsions.

* The variable's right-most dimensions must be axes defined by the SRS
  (i.e., longitude and latitude), and they must match the SRS's axis'
  order.

* Other dimensions of the variable must be 'to the left' of the
  dimensions defined by the SRS.

* The _range_ of the coverage comprises the values of the
  variable. These values must have an associated _unit of measure_.

* _Describe how variable shape affects whether a variable can be a
  coverage. Or say whatever is correct._

//TODO: Fix this list.

NOTE: In practice, Hyrax is often used with data that have global
extent, which corresponds to the SRS _WGS84_ (aka _EPSG 4326_), and the
current version of the WCS service only supports this SRS.

TIP: We're interested in adding support for WCS 2.1, but we'd like to 
gague the interest of potential users before we commit any development
resources. The standard metadata for WCS 2.0 is limited to 
representing two-dimensional data, so variables in a dataset with 
three or more dimensions cannot be completely described by the 
_CoverageDescription_ response. WCS 2.1, on the other hand, 
can represent domains with more than two dimensions.

[[WCS_installation_guide]]
== WCS Installation

The WCS 2 service comes bundled as part of Hyrax-1.14.0 and newer.
See the 
<<Download_and_Install_Hyrax, Hyrax download and installation guide>>
included earlier in this document to get Hyrax installed and running, 
and then return to this guide for WCS configuration information.

Assuming that you have Hyrax installed and running on your local system,
you should be able to quickly verify the WCS service is available by
pointing your browser at the default WCS endpoint:
http://localhost:8080/opendap/wcs. This link should return a browser
renderable HTML page of the _Capabilities_ document with a conspicuously
empty _Contents_ section.

== Configuration

Because WCS requires certain metadata to work (whereas DAP can
function with nothing more than a variable's name and type), our
service provides a way to use WCS with DAP datasets that natively lack
the required WCS metadata. We do this by creating mappings (DynamicService
instances) between collections of DAP datasets that have similar
domain coordinates and a WCS service for the resulting Coverages.
These relationships are expressed in the _wcs_service.xml_ configuration
file, a simple XML document.

<1> The _DynamicService_ creates a WCS by creating a link between DAP datasets
matching the regex and the WCS meta information provided in the DynamicService definition.
<2> *prefix*: This is a simple string used by the WcsCatalog implementation to
distinguish each DynamicService. Choosing a value that is in some way related to the
collection being serviced can be helpful to people if there are problems later.
<3> *name*: A human readable and meaningful name that will be used by the server when it
creates a link to the service in the _viewers_ page.
<4> *pathMatch*: The value of `pathMatch` contains a regular expression that
the server uses to determine which DAP datasets will be associated with this
DynamicService.
<5> *srs*:  The _srs_ attribute defines the expected SRS for the coverages associated
with this DynamicService. The SRS defines the axis labels, order, units and
minimum number of domain coordinate dimensions and will be used for any dataset
that does not contain an explicit SRS definition. Currently only 
_urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326_ is supported.

NOTE: Currently the only supported SRS is `urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326`

=== Using `pathMatch`

The `pathMatch` attribute is used to assign a WCS DynamicService definition
to some subset (or possibly all) of the Datasets available through the 
Hyrax server. This is accomplished by applying the regular expression 
contained in the value of the `pathMatch` attribute to the _local name_
(aka _local url_, _path part of url_, etc. ) of a candidate dataset.

[cols="25,75"]
|===
|For example in this URL
|http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc
|The DAP service endpoint is:
|http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/
| And the _local name_ is:
| `/data/nc/fnoc1.nc`
|===

////
For example in this URL:
`http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc`

The DAP service endpoint is `http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/`
////
So for this dataset, the string `/data/nc/fnoc1.nc` would be compared
to the  `pathMatch` regex when determing if a DynamicService  endpoint
should be advertised in the `viewers` page for the dataset.

In the previous example the `pathMatch` attribute is set like this:

    pathMatch="^/testbed-13/M2SDNXSLV\.5\.12\.4/.*$"

This value tells the server to assocaiate this WCS definition with any
DAP dataset whose local path name on the server matches the regular
expression `^/testbed-13/M2SDNXSLV\.5\.12\.4/.*$`, which can be read as,
"_Anything that starts with_ `/testbed-13/M2SDNXSLV.5.12.4/`."

Regular expressions are very flexible and it is possible to
use them to specify a number of things at a time.

==== `pathMatch` Regular Expression Example 1

Consider the following `pathMatch` regular expression:

    pathMatch="^.*coads.*\.nc$"

This will match any dataset path that contains the word "coads"
and that ends with ".nc".

==== `pathMatch` Regular Expression Example 2

Consider the following `pathMatch` regular expression:

 pathMatch="^/gesdisc/(M2IMNXINT|M2TMNXCHM|M2SDNXSLV|M2I1NXASM|M2TMNPMST)\.5\.12\.4/.*$"

This will match any dataset whose name begins with the following: 

* `/gesdisc/M2IMNXINT.5.12.4/`
* `/gesdisc/M2TMNXCHM.5.12.4/`
* `/gesdisc/M2SDNXSLV.5.12.4/`
* `/gesdisc/M2I1NXASM.5.12.4/`
* `/gesdisc/M2TMNPMST.5.12.4/`

The `pathMatch` feature allows a DynamicService definition to be associated
with a sort of "virtual collection" of datasets on the server, which may
be related merely by the fact that their coverage representations are similar.

=== Domain Coordinate Definitions

The Hyrax WCS relies on the DynamicService definition to be responsible for
identifying the specific variables in the DAP datasets that are to be used
for the geo-referenced domain coordinates of the coverage. The domain 
coordinates must appear in the order that they appear in the dimensions of 
the DAP dataset. They must also match the order of axes represented in the SRS.

WARNING: If there is an unresolvable conflict, the DAP dataset cannot 
be served as a Coverage until a suitable SRS can be identified.

Many DAP datasets have variables with more than two dimensions, and in
general WCS 2.0 only supports 2D data. However, latitude, longitude,
and time are frequently seen as domain coordinates in scientific data.
These can be utilized in the WCS as long as the inner most (last)
two dimensions are in agreement with the SRS.

NOTE: In the WCS data model *time* is not considered a "domain coordinate,"
and is therefore not represented in the SRS. Yet it does accomodate
transmitting the time domain to the client and subsetting the time domain
in the manner of latitude and longitude. The result is that 3D datasets
with time, latitude, and longitude fit easily into the WCS model.

In the server we treat time like any other coordinate dimension, so if
there is a time dimension on the data, it needs to appear in the set of
DomainCoordinate definitions for the service.

Let's consider the DomainCoordinate definitions from the example above:

[source,xml]
-----
<DomainCoordinate
    name="time"
    dapID="time"
    size="1"
    units="Days since 1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    min="690"
    max="690" />
<DomainCoordinate
    name="latitude"
    dapID="lat"
    size="361"
    units="deg"
    min="-90"
    max="90" />
<DomainCoordinate
    name="longitude"
    dapID="lon"
    size="576"
    units="deg"
    min="-180"
    max="180" />
-----

In our friend EPSG:4326, we know that the axis order is
`latitude,longitude` and that's the order in the example. There is
also an additional time coordinate which comes prior to the 
defintions for `latitude` and `longitude`.

Consider the `latitude` DomainCoordinate:

[source,xml]
-----
<DomainCoordinate name="latitude" dapID="lat" size="361" units="deg" min="-90.0" max="90.0"/>
-----

This tells the service that the coordinate axis named `latitude` is
bound to the DAP variable `lat`, that a default value for _size_ is
361 elements, the default _units_ are degrees ("deg"), the default
minimum value is -90.0 and the default maximum value is 90.0. What
this means is that when the DynamicService processes a DAP dataset
into a coverage, it will check the dataset's metadata for this type of
information. If any of these values can be determined from the dataset
metadata, then that value is used; otherwise the values expressed in
the DomainCoordinate definition are used.

Longitude and time are handled in the same way as latitude.

=== Providing Field defintions

Many DAP datasets either lack the metadata for determining which
variables will make suitable coverages or the information may not be in an
expected form or location. In order to enable these datasets to be
exposed via WCS, Hyrax allows the definition of a field in the
_DynamicService_ element.

NOTE: WCS Field names have limitations on the kinds of characters they
can contain. Specifically, these field names must be
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1631396/what-is-an-xsncname-type-and-when-should-it-be-used[NCNAMEs],
which means that they cannot contain special symbols such as @, $, %,
&, /, +, most punctuation, spaces, tabs, newlines or parentheses.
Furthermore, they cannot begin with a digit, dot (.) or minus (-),
although those can appear later in the name. Because DAP variables do
not have such a limitation, you may have to provide a new name for the
variable.

In the following _DynamicService_ definition, each variable in the
dataset is exposed as a WCS field and basic information required by
WCS is provided.
