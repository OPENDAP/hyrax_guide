== Logging Configuration Introduction

We see logging activities falling into two categories:

* *Access Logging* - Is used to monitor server usage, server performance,
and to see which resources are receiving the most attention. Tomcat has
a very nice built-in Access Logging mechanism; all you have to do is
turn it on.
* *Informational and debug logging* - Most developers (myself included)
rely on a collection of imbedded "instrumentation" that allows them to
monitor their code and see what parts are being executed. Typically we
like to design this instrumentation so that it can be enabled or disabled
at runtime. Hyrax has this type of debugging instrumentation and ships
with it disabled, but you could enable it. If you were to encounter an
internal problem with Hyrax, you should enable different aspects of
the instrumentation at you site, so that we can review the output to
determine the issue.

=== Access Logging

Many people will want to record access logs for their Hyrax server. *We*
want you to keep access logs for your Hyrax server. The easiest way to
get a simple access log for Hyrax is to utilize the Tomcat/Catalina
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/config/valve.html[Valve
Component].

==== AccessLogValve

Since Hyrax's public facade is provided by the OLFS running inside of
the Tomcat servlet container, you may utilize Tomcat's handy access
logging which relies on the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/catalina/docs/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/AccessLogValve.html[org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve
class] class. By default Tomcat comes with this turned off.

To turn it on,

. Locate the file $CATALINA_HOME/conf/servlet.html.
. Find the commented out section for the access log inside the <Host>
element. The server.xml file contains a good deal of comments, both for
instruction and containing code examples. The part you are looking for
is nested inside of the <Service> and the <Engine> elements. Typically
it will look like:

----
<Service ...>
    .
    .
    .
    <Engine...>
        .
        .
        .
        <Host name="localhost" appBase="webapps"
            unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true"
            xmlValidation="false" xmlNamespaceAware="false">
            .
            .
            .           
            <!-- Access log processes all requests for this virtual host.  
                 By default, log files are created in the "logs" 
                 directory relative to $CATALINA_HOME.  If you wish, you can 
                 specify a different directory with the "directory"
                 attribute.  Specify either a relative (to $CATALINA_HOME) 
                 or absolute path to the desired directory. -->
                 
            <!--
            <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve" 
                   directory="logs"  prefix="localhost_access_log." suffix=".txt"
                   pattern="common" resolveHosts="false"/>  
            --/>
            .
            .
            .
        </Host>
        .
        .
        .
    </Engine>
    .
    .
    .
</Service>
----

You can uncomment the <__Valve__> element to enable it, and you can
change the values of the various attributes to suite your localization.
For example:

----
            <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve" 
                   directory="logs"  
                   prefix="access_log." 
                   suffix=".log" 
                   pattern="%h %l %u %t &quot;%r&quot; %s %b %D"
                   resolveHosts="false"/>
----

[start=3]
. Save the file.
. Restart Tomcat.
. Read your log files.

*Note* that the _pattern_ atribute allows you to customize the
content of the access log entries. It is documented in the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/catalina/docs/api/index.html[javadocs
for Tomcat/Catalina] as part of the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/catalina/docs/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/AccessLogValve.html[org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve]
class and here in the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/config/valve.html[Server
Configuration Reference]. The pattern shown above will provide log
output that looks like the example below:

----
        69.59.200.52 - - [05/Mar/2007:16:29:14 -0800] "GET /opendap/data/nc/contents.html HTTP/1.1" 200 13014 234
        69.59.200.52 - - [05/Mar/2007:16:29:14 -0800] "GET /opendap/docs/images/logo.gif HTTP/1.1" 200 8114 2
        69.59.200.52 - - [05/Mar/2007:16:29:51 -0800] "GET /opendap/data/nc/TestPatDbl.nc.html HTTP/1.1" 200 11565 137
        69.59.200.52 - - [05/Mar/2007:16:29:56 -0800] "GET /opendap/data/nc/data.nc.ddx HTTP/1.1" 200 2167 121

The last column is the time in milliseconds it took to service the
request and the next to the last column is the number of bytes returned.

=== Informational and Debug Logging (Using the Logback implementation of Log4j)

In general you shouldn't have to modify the default logging
configuration for Hyrax. It may become necessary if you encounter
problems, but otherwise we suggest you leave it be.

Having said that, Hyrax uses the Logback logging package to provide an
easily configurable and flexible logging environment. All "console"
output is routed through the Logback package and can be controlled using
the Logback configuration file.

There are several logging levels available:

* TRACE
* DEBUG
* INFO
* WARN
* ERROR
* FATAL

Hyrax ships with a default logging level of *ERROR*.

Additionally, Hyrax maintains its own access log using Logback.

NOTE: We strongly recommend that you take the time to
http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html[read about Logback and Log4j]
before you attempt to manipulate the Logback configuration.

==== Configuration File Location

Logback gets its configuration from an XML file. Hyrax locates this
file in the following manner:

. Checks the <init-parameter> list for the hyrax servlet (in the
web.xml) for a an <init-parameter> called "logbackConfig". If found, the
value of this parameter is assumed to be a fully qualified path name for
the file. This can be used to specify alternate Logback config files. +
*Note:* This configuration will not be persistent across new
installations of Hyrax. We do *not* recommend setting this parameter, as
doing so is not persistent--it will be overridden the next time the Web
ARchive file is deployed.

. Failing 1: Hyrax then checks in the persistent content directory
(<<OLFS-config-location, set by either the OLFS_CONFIG_DIR environment variable or in /etc/olfs>>) 
for the file "logback-test.xml". If this file is present then it will be
used to configure logging, and new installations of Hyrax will detect and
use this logging configuration automatically.

. Failing 2: Hyrax then checks in the persistent content directory
(<<OLFS-config-location, set by either the OLFS_CONFIG_DIR environment variable or in /etc/olfs>>)
for the file "logback.xml". If this file is present then it will be used to
configure logging, and new installations of Hyrax will detect and use
this logging configuration automatically.

. Failing 3: Hyrax falls back to the logback.xml file shipped with the
distribution which is located in the
_$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF_ directory. Changes made to this
file will be lost when a new version of Hyrax is installed or the
opendap.war Web ARchive file is redeployed.

So - if you want to customize your Hyrax logging and have it be
persistent, do it by copying the distributed logback.xml file
(_$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF/logback.xml_) to the 
persistent content directory
(<<OLFS-config-location, set by either the OLFS_CONFIG_DIR environment variable or in /etc/olfs>>)
and editing that copy.

==== Configuration

Did you http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html[read about LogBack and
Log4j]? Great!

There are a number of _Appenders_ defined in the Hyrax _log4j.xml_ file:

* *stdout* - Loggers using this Appender will send everything to the
console/stdout - which in a Tomcat environment will get shunted into the
file _$TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out_.
* *devNull* - Loggers using this Appender will not log. All messages
will be discarded. This is the Log4j equivalent of piping your output
into _/dev/null_ in a UNIX environment.
* *ErrorLog* - Loggers using this Appender will have their log output
placed in the error log file in the persistent content directory:
_$TOMCAT_HOME/content/opendap/logs/error.log_.
* *HyraxAccessLog* - Loggers using this Appender will have their log
output placed in the access log file in the persistent content
directory: _$TOMCAT_HOME/content/opendap/logs/HyraxAccess.log_

The default configuration pushes *ERROR* level (and higher) messages
into the *ErrorLog*, and logs accesses using *HyraxAccessLog*. You
can turn on debugging level logging by changing the log level to *DEBUG*
for the software components you are interested in. All of the OPeNDAP
code is in the "opendap" package. The following configuration
will cause all log messages of *ERROR* level or higher to be sent to the
error log:

----
    <logger name="opendap" level="error"/>
        <appender-ref ref="ErrorLog"/>
    </logger>
----

The following configuration
will cause all messages of level *INFO'* or higher to be sent to
*stdout*, which (in Tomcat) means that they will get stuck in the file
_$TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out_.

----
    <logger name="opendap" level="info"/>
        <appender-ref ref="stdout"/>
    </logger>
----

Be sure to get in touch if you have further questions about the logging
configuration.
