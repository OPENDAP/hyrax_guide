== OLFS Configuration Introduction

This document should help you get started configuring the OLFS web
application component of Hyrax. This software package was developed,
compiled, and tested using the java 1.6.x compiler, the 1.6.x Java
Virtual Machine, and Jakarta Tomcat 7.x.x (which also provided the
javax.servlet packages).

The OLFS web application is composed of these servlets:

* *Hyrax servlet* - The Hyrax servlet provides DAP (and other) services
for the Hyrax server. The Hyrax servlet does the majority of the work in
the OLFS web application. It does this by providing a flexible
"dispatch" mechanism through which incoming requests are evaluated by a
series of DispatchHandlers (pieces of software) that can choose to
handle or ignore the request. The OLFS ships with a standard set of
DispathHandlers which handle requests for OPeNDAP data products, THREDDS
catalogs, and OPeNDAP directories. These defalut DispatchHandlers can be
augmented by adding custom handlers without the need to recompile the
software. All of the DispatchHandlers used by the Hyrax servlet are
identified in the *olfs.xml* configuration file.
* *Viewers servlet* - The Viewers servlet provides a service for
datasets through which both the Web Services and Java WebStart applications that
might be used with the dataset are identified.
The Viewers servlet is configured via the *viewers.xml* file.
* *Docs servlet* - The Docs servlet provides clients access to a tree of
static documents. By default, a minimal set of documents are provided
(containing information about Hyrax). These can be replaced by user
supplied documents and images. By changing the images and documents
available through the Docs servlet, the data provider can further
customize the appearance and layout of the Hyrax server web pages, making them
conform better to their parent organization's visual identity. The Docs
servlet has no specific configuration file.
* <<admin-interface, *Admin Interface Servlet*>> - The Hyrax Administration 
Interface (HAI) provides server administrators with a GUI for monitoring,
controlling, and configuring the server.
* <<gateway-service, *Gateway Servlet*>> - The Gateway Servlet provides 
a gateway service that allows Hyrax to be configured to
retrieve files (that the server recognizes as data) from the web and
then provides DAP services for the retrieved files. The
Gateway servlet does not require additional configuration, yet the
BES must be correctly configured to perform gateway tasks.

Additionally the OLFS web application relies on one or more instances of the 
<<bess-configuration, BES>> to provide it with
data access and basic catalog metadata.

The OLFS web application stores its configuration state in a number of
files. The server's configuration is altered by carefully modifying the
content of one or more of these files and then restarting the web
application (or simply restarting Tomcat).

The remainder of this document is concerned with how to correctly
configure the Hyrax and Viewers servlets - the primary components of the
OLFS web application.

[[OLFS-config-location]]
=== OLFS Configuration Location

Beginning with olfs-1.15.0 (part of hyrax-1.13.0) the OLFS will use the
following procedure to locating it's configuration:

. It will first look at the value of the user environment variable
`OLFS_CONFIG_DIR`. If the variable is set and its value is the pathname
of an existing directory that is readable by Tomcat, it is used.
Otherwise,
. If the directory `/etc/olfs` exists and is readable it will use
that. Otherwise,
. It will utilize the default configuration bundled with in the web
application web archive file (opendap.war).

In this way the OLFS can start without a persistent local configuration.
If the default configuration works for your intended use, then there is
no need create a persistent localized configuration. If changes need to
be made to the configuration, then it is *strongly recommended* that the
user enable the use of a persistent local configuration. This way
updating the web application won't destroy your changes. This is easily
done by creating an empty directory and identifying it with the
`OLFS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable. For example:

----
export OLFS_CONFIG_DIR="/home/tomcat/hyrax"
----

Alternatively, you can create the directory `/etc/olfs`, and ensure that
it is both readable and writeable by Tomcat.

Once the directory is created (and in the former case the environment
variable is set) restart the OLFS (Tomcat). This will cause the OLFS to
move a copy of its default configuration into the empty directory and
then utilize it. You can then edit the local copy.

=== Retired

In olfs-1.14.1 (part of hyrax-1.12.2) and earlier, the OLFS web
application was located in the 'persistent content directory':
__$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap__. This caused bootstrap problems when
the OLFS tried to set itself up on a Linux system in which the Tomcat
installation had been done via RPM.

=== OLFS Files

The OLFS web application gets its configuration from four files. In general
all of your configuration need will be met by making changes to the
first two: *olfs.xml* and *catalog.xml*

*olfs.xml* ::
  *Role*: Contains the localized OLFS configuration - location of the
  BES(s), directory view instructions, etc. +
  *Location:* In the persistent content directory which by default is
  located at _$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/_

*catalog.xml* ::
  *Role*: Master(top-level) THREDDS catalog content for static THREDDS
  catalogs. +
  *Location:* In the persistent content directory which by default is
  located at _$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/_

*viewers.xml* ::
  *Role*: Contains the localized Viewers configuration. +
  *Location:* In the persistent content directory which by default is
  located at _$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/_

*web.xml* ::
  *Role*: Core servlet configuration. +
  *Location:* The servlet's web.xml file located in the WEB-INF
  directory of the web application "opendap". Typically that means
  _$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF/web.xml_

*log4j.xml* ::
  *Role*: Contains the logging configuration for Hyrax. +
  *Location:* The default location for the _log4j.xml_ is in the
  WEB-INF directory of the web application "opendap". Typically that
  means _$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF/log4j.xml_ However,
  Hyrax can be configured to look in additional places for the
  _log4j.xml_ file. <<logging-configuration, Read More About It Here>>.

== Hyrax Servlet Configuration

The Hyrax servlet is the front end (public interface) for
<<hyrax-overview, Hyrax>>. It provides DAP services, THREDDS
catalogs, directory views, logging, and authentication services. This is
accomplished through a collection of software components called
DispatchHandlers. At startup the Hyrax servlet reads the *olfs.xml* file
which contains a list of DispatchHandlers and their configurations.
DispatchHandlers on the list are loaded, configured/initialized, and
then used to provide the aforementioned services.

=== Dispatch Handlers

Request dispatch is the process by which the OLFS determines
what actual piece of code is going to respond to a given incoming
request. This version of the OLFS handles each incoming request by
offering the request to a series of DispatchHandlers. Each
DispatchHandler is asked if it can handle the request. The first
DispatchHandler to say that it can handle the request is then asked to
do so. The OLFS creates an ordered list of DispatchHandlers objects in
memory by reading the **olfs.xml**.

The order of the list is significant. There is no guarantee that two (or
more) DispatchHandlers may claim a particular request. Since the first
DispatchHandler in the list to claim a request gets to service it,
changing the order of the DispatchHandlers can change the behavior of
the OLFS (and thus of Hyrax). For example the URL
`http://localhost:8080/opendap/data/` is recognized by both the 
_DirectoryDispatchHandler_ and the _ThreddsDispatchHandler_, each of which 
can provide a directory view; however, only the _DirectoryDispatchHandler_ 
can be configured to reject the request and pass it on to another
handler, in this case the _ThreddsDispatchHandler_. The
result is that if you put the _ThreddsDispatchHandler_ prior to the
_DirectoryDispatchHandler_ on the list, there will be no way to
//*Not sure if this should be simly "OPeNDAP" or "an OPeNDAP"*
get an OPeNDAP directory view - the _ThreddsDispatchHandler_ will claim
them all.

This dispatching scheme is useful because it creates
extensibility. If a third party wishes to add new functionality to Hyrax,
one way is to write a DispatchHandler. To incorporate it into Hyrax, they
need only add it to the list in the *olfs.xml* and add the java
classes to the Tomcat lib directory.

=== *olfs.xml* Configuration File

The *olfs.xml* file contains the core configuration of the Hyrax
servlet:

. It configures the BESManager with at least one BES to be used by the OLFS
web application.
. It identifies all of the DispatchHandlers to be used by the Hyrax
servlet.
. It controls both view and access behaviours of the Hyrax servlet.

=== OLFSConfig Element

The <__OLFSConfig__> element is the document root. It contains two
elements that suppy the configuration for the OLFS: <__BesManager__> and
<__DispatchHandlers__ >.

=== *<BESManager>* Element (required)

The BESManager element provides configuration for the BESManager class.
The BESManager is used 
//in various parts of the OLFS web application
whenever the software needs to access BES's services. This
configuration is key to the function of Hyrax, for in it 
is defined each BES that is connected to a Hyrax installation. The following examples
will show a single BES example. For more information on configuring Hyrax to use multiple BES's
<<config-hyrax-mult-BESs, look here>>.

Each BES is identified using a seperate <__BES__> child element inside
of the <__BESManager__> element.

==== *<BES>* Element (required)

The <__BES__> element provides the OLFS with connection and control
information for a BES. There are 4 child elements in a <__BES__>
element: <__prefix__>, <__host__>, <__port__>, and <__ClientPool__>.

==== *<prefix>* Element (required)

This child element of the <__BES__> element contains the URL prefix that
the OLFS will associate with this BES. This provides a mapping between
this BES to the URI space serviced by the OLFS. The prefix, then, is 
a token that is placed between the
_host:port/context/_ part of the Hyrax URL and the catalog root.
The catalog root is used to designate a particular BES instance in the
event that multiple BES's are available to a single OLFS.

For a single BES (the default configuration) the tag *must* be designated 
by "/". This prefix provides a mapping for each BES connected to the OLFS
and the URI space serviced by the OLFS.

. There *must* be at least one BES element in the BESManager 
handler configuration whose prefix has a value of "/" (see _example 1_).
There may be more than one <_BES_>, but only that one is required.
. For a single BES (the one with "/" as its prefix) no additional
effort is required; however, when using multiple BES's it is neccesary
that each BES has a mount point exposed as a directory (aka collection)
in the URI space where it's going to appear. See
<<config-hyrax-mult-BESs, Configuring With Multiple BES's>>
for more information.
. The prefix string *must* always begin with the slash ("/")
character. (See __example 2__.)

_Example 1:_

----
 <prefix>/</prefix>
----

_Example 2:_

----
 <prefix>/data/nc</prefix>
----

==== *<host>* Element (required)

This child element of the <__BES__> element contains the host name or IP
address of the BES.

_Example:_

----
<host>test.opendap.org</host >
----

==== *<port>* Element (required)

This child element of the <__BES__> element contains port number on
which the BES is listening.

_Example:_
----
<port>10022</port >
----

==== *<timeOut>* Element (optional)

This child element of the <__BES__> element contains the timeout time,
in seconds, for the OLFS to wait for this BES to respond. Defaults to 300
seconds.

_Example:_

----
<timeOut>600</timeOut >
----

==== *<maxResponseSize>* Element (optional)

This child element of the <__BES__> element contains in bytes
the maximum response size allowed for this BES. Requests that produce a
larger response will receive an error. A value of zero (_0_)
indicates that there is no imposed limit. The default value is 0.

_Example:_

---- 
<maxResponseSize>0</maxResponseSize>
----

==== *<ClientPool>* Element (optional)

This child element of the <__BES__> element configures the behavior of
the pool of client connections that the OLFS maintains with this
particular BES. These connections are pooled for efficiency and speed.
Currently, the only configuration item available is to control the
maximum number of concurrent BES client connections that the OLFS can
make. The default is 200, but the size should be optimized for your
locale by empirical testing. The size of the Client Pool is controlled
by the _maximum_ attribute. The default value of _maximum_ is 200.

_Example:_

---- 
<ClientPool maximum="17" />
----

If the <ClientPool> element is missing, the pool size defaults to 200.

==== *<adminPort>* element (optional)

This child element of the <__BES__> element contains the port on the BES
system that can be used by the Hyrax Admin Interface to control the BES.
THe BES must also be configured to open and utilize this admin port.

_Example:_

---- 
<adminPort>11002</adminPort>
----

==== Example BESManager Configuration Element

---- 
<BESManager>
    <BES>
        <prefix>/</prefix>
        <host>localhost</host>
        <port>10022</port>
        <timeOut>300</timeOut>
        <maxResponseSize>0</maxResponseSize>
        <ClientPool maximum="10" maxCmds="2000" />
        <adminPort>11002</adminPort>
    </BES>
</BESManager >
----

=== *<CatalogCache>* Element

The catalog cache element configures the OLFS memory cache of BES
catalog responses. This cache can greatly increase server performance
for small requests. It is configured by it's two child elements,
`maxEntries` and `updateIntervalSeconds`.

* The value of `maxEntries` determines the total number of catalog
responses to hold in memory. The default value for `maxEntries` is
10000.
* The value of `updateIntervalSeconds` determines how long the catalog
update thread will sleep between updates. This value affects the server's
responsiveness to changes in its holdings. If your server's contents
changes frequently, then the `updateIntervalSeconds` should be set to a
value that will allow the server to publish new additions/deletions in a
timely manner. The `updateIntervalSeconds` default value 10000 seconds
(2.7 hours).
* If for some reason you wish to disable the `CatalogCache`, simply
remove (or comment out) the `CatalogCache` element and its children
from the `olfs.xml` file.

=== *<DispatchHandlers>* Element

The <__DispatchHandlers__> element has two child elements:
<__HttpGetHandlers__> and <__HttpPostHandlers__>. The
<__HttpGetHandlers__> contains an ordered list of the DispatchHandler
classes used by the OLFS to handle incoming HTTP GET requests.

=== *<HttpGetHandlers>* Element

The <__HttpGetHandlers__> contains an ordered list of the
DispatchHandler classes used by the OLFS to handle incoming HTTP GET
requests. The list order is significant, and permutating the order will
(probably negatively) change the behavior of the OLFS. Each
DispatchHandler on the list will be asked to handle the request. The
first DispatchHandler on the list to claim the request will be asked to
build the response.

=== *<HttpPostHandlers>* Element

While programmatic support for POST request handlers as part of the
Hyrax servlet, there are currently no HttpPostHandlers implemented for
use with Hyrax. Maybe down the road...
//*I'm not so sure about the "Maybe down the road..." ACP *

=== *<Handler>* Elements

Both the <__HttpGetHandlers__> and <__HttpPostHandlers__> contain an
orderd list of <__Handler__> elements. Each <__Handler__> must have an
attribute called _className_ whose value is set to the fully qualified
Java class name for the DispatchHandler implementation to be used. For
example, `<Handler className="opendap.bes.VersionDispatchHandler" />` 
names the class __opendap.bes.VersionDispatchHandler__.

Each <__Handler__> element may contain a collection of child elements
that provide configuration information to the DispatchHandler
implementation. In this example,

----
  <Handler className="opendap.coreServlet.BotBlocker">
      <IpAddress&>44.55.66.77</IpAddress>
  </Handler>
----

the <__Handler__> element contains a child element (<__IpAddress__>) that
indicates to the _BotBlocker_ class to block requests from the IP
address 44.55.66.77.

=== HTTP GET Handlers

Hyrax uses the following DispatchHandlers to handle HTTP GET requests:

* *VersionDispatchHandler:* Handles the version document requests.
* *BotBlocker:* An optional handler that may be used to block individual IP 
  addresses or groups of IP addresses from accessing your server.
* *NcmlDatasetDispatcher:* Specialized handler that filters NcML
  content retrieved from the BES
* *StaticCatalogDispatch:* Provides static THREDDS catalog services for Hyrax.
* *Gateway:* For more imformation, see the documentation for 
   <<gateway-service, Gateway Service>>.
* *DapDispatcher:* Handles all DAP requests.
* *DirectoryDispatchHandler:* Handles the OPeNDAP directory view (contents.html) requests.
* *BESThreddsDispatchHandler:* Provides dynamic THREDDS catalogs of all BES holdings.
* *FileDispatchHandler:* Handles requests for file level access. (README files etc.)

=== VersionDispatchHandler (required)

Handles the version document requests. This DispatchHandler has no
configuration elements, so it will always be written like this:

----
<Handler className="opendap.bes.VersionDispatchHandler" />
----

[[bot-blocker]]
=== BotBlocker (optional)

This optional handler can be used to block access from specific IP
addresses or a range of IP addresses using regular expressions. It
turns out that many of the web crawling robots do not respect the
robots.txt file when one is provided. Since many sites do not want their
data holdings exhaustively queried by automated software, we created a
simple robot blocking handler to protect system resources from
non-compliant robots.

==== *<IpAddress>* Element

The text value of this element should be the IP address of a system
which you would like to block from accessing your service.

For example, 
`<IpAddress>128.193.64.33</IPAddress>` blocks the system located at 
128.193.64.33 from accessing your server.
There can be zero or more <IpAddress> elements in the <BotBlocker>.

==== *< IpMatch >* Element

The text value of this element should be the regular expression that
will be used to match the IP addresses of clients attempting to access
Hyrax.

For example, `<IpMatch>65\.55\.[012]?\d?\d\.[012]?\d?\d</IpMatch>`
matches all IP addresses beginning with 65.55 and thus blocks access for
clients whose IP addresses lie in that range. There can be zero or more
< IpMatch > elements in the Handler configuration for the BotBlocker

==== Example Configuration Element

----
    <Handler className="opendap.coreServlet.BotBlocker">
 
        <IpAddress>127.0.0.1</IpAddress>
 
        <!-- This matches all IPv4 addresses, work yours out from here.... -->
        <!--<IpMatch>[012]?\d?\d\.[012]?\d?\d\.[012]?\d?\d\.[012]?\d?\d</IpMatch> -->
 
        <!-- Any IP starting with 65.55 (MSN bots the don't respect robots.txt  -->
        <IpMatch>65\.55\.[012]?\d?\d\.[012]?\d?\d</IpMatch>
 
    </Handler>
----

=== Ncml Dataset Dispatcher (required)

The Ncml Dataset Dispatcher is a specialized handler that filters NcML
content retrieved from the BES so that the path names in the NcML
documents returned to clients are consistent with the paths from the
external (to the server) perspective:

----
    <Handler className="opendap.ncml.NcmlDatasetDispatcher" />
----

=== Static Thredds Catalog Dispatch Handler (required)

Serves static THREDDS catalogs (i.e. THREDDS catalog files stored on
disk). It provides both a presentation view (HTML) for humans using
browsers and direct catalog access (XML).

==== *<prefix>* Element (required)

Defines the path component that comes after the servlet context and
before all catalog requests. For example, if the prefix is _thredds_,
then http://localhost:8080/opendap/thredds/ should give you the
top-level static catalog (the contents of the file
_$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/catalog.xml_)

==== *<useMemoryCache>* Element (optional)

If the text value of this element is the string 'true,' this will cause
the servlet to ingest all of the static catalog files at startup and
hold their contents in memory.
<<THREDDS-config, See this page for more information about the memory caching operations.>>

==== *<ingestTransformFile>* Element (optional)

This is a specific development option that allows one to specify the
fully qualified path to an XSLT file that will be used to preprocess
each THREDDS catalog file read from disk. The default version of this
file (found in
_$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opndap/xsl/threddsCatalogIngest.xsl_) processes
the _thredds:datasetScan_ elements in each THREDDS catalog so that they
contain specific content for Hyrax:

NOTE: This is a developers option and in general is not recommended 
for use in an operational server.

==== Example Configuration Element

----
<Handler className="opendap.threddsHandler.StaticCatalogDispatch">
     <prefix>thredds</prefix>
     <useMemoryCache>true</useMemoryCache>
</Handler>
----

=== Gateway Dispatcher

Directs requests to the <<gateway-service, Gateway Service>>.

==== *<prefix>* Element (required)

Defines the path component that comes after the servlet context and
before all gateway requests. For example, if the prefix is _gateway_,
then http://localhost:8080/opendap/gateway/ will give you the gateway
access form page.

==== Example Configuration Element

---- 
<Handler className="opendap.gateway.DispatchHandler">
    <prefix>gateway</prefix>
</Handler>
----

=== DapDispatchHandler (required)

Handles DAP request for Hyrax. For example, the DapDispatchHandler will
handle requests for all DAP2 and DAP4 products

==== *<AllowDirectDataSourceAccess>* Element (optional)

The <__AllowDirectDataSourceAccess__ /> element controls the user's
ability to directly access data sources via the web interface. If this
element is present (and not commented out, as in the example below) a
client can get an entire data source (such as an HDF file) by
requesting it through the HTTP URL interface. This is *not* a good
practice and is not recommended. By default, Hyrax ships with this option
disabled. We recommend that you leave it unchanged unless you requre
that users be able to circumvent the OPeNDAP request interface and
have direct access to the data products stored on your server.

==== *<UseDAP2ResourceUrlResponse>* Element (optional)

// NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE "AT LEAST FOR NOW" ACP
By default, at least for now, the server will provide the (undefined)
DAP2 style response to requests for a dataset resource URL. Commenting
out the "UseDAP2ResourceUrlResponse" element will cause the server to
return the (well-defined) DAP4 DSR response when a dataset resource URL
is requested.

==== Example Configuration Element

----
<Handler className="opendap.bes.dapResponders.DapDispatcher" >
    <!-- AllowDirectDataSourceAccess / -->
    <UseDAP2ResourceUrlResponse />
</Handler>
----

=== DirectoryDispatchHandler (required)

Handles the OPeNDAP directory view (contents.html) requests:

----
<Handler className="opendap.bes.DirectoryDispatchHandler" />
----

=== BES Thredds Dispatch Handler (required)

Provides dynamic THREDDS catalogs of BES data holdings:

----
<Handler className="opendap.bes.BESThreddsDispatchHandler" />
----

=== File Dispatch Handler (required)

Handles requests for file level access (README files, etc.). This
handler only responds to requests for files that are not considered
"data" by the BES. File requests for data files are handled by the
_opendap.bes.dapResponders.DapDispatcher_.

In the following example, the FileDispatchHandler is configured to deny
direct access to data sources (note that the
<__AllowDirectDataSourceAccess__ /> element is commented out):

---- 
<Handler className="opendap.bes.FileDispatchHandler" />
----

=== HTTP POST Handlers

Hyrax does not currently support HTTP POST requests.

=== Example olfs.xml File

=== _web.xml_ Configuration File

We strongly recommend that you do *NOT* modfiy the web.xml file at 
this time. Future versions of Server and the OLFS may have "user
configurable" parameters in the web.xml file, but this version does not,
_and doing so will almost certainly result in *severe* problems_. That 
being said, the following is the details regarding the web.xml file.

==== Servlet Definition

The OLFS running in the OPeNDAP context area needs an entry in the
_web.xml_ file. Multiple instances of a servlet and/or several different
servlets can be configured in the one web.xml file. For instance, you
could have a DTS and a Hyrax running from the same _web.xml_ and thus
under the same servlet context. Running multiple instances of the OLFS
in a single web.xml file (aka context) will *NOT* work.

Each a servlet needs a unique name which is specified inside a
<__servlet__> element in the web.xml file using the <__servlet-name__>
tag. This is a name of convenience; for example, if one is serving
data from an ARGOS satellite one might call that servlet __argos__.

Additionally, each instance of a <__servlet__> must specify which Java
class contains the actual servlet to run. This is done in the
<__servlet-class__> element. For example, the OLFS servlet class name is
_opendap.coreServlet.DispatchServlet_.

===== Syntax Example

----
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>hyrax</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>opendap.coreServlet.DispatchServlet</servlet-name>
    .
    .
    .
</servlet>
----

This servlet could then be accessed as
_http://hostname/opendap/servlet/argos_.

You may also add to the end of the web.xml file a set of
<__servlet-mapping__> elements. These allow you to abbreviate the URL or
the servlet. By placing the servlet mappings at the end of the web.xml 
file, our previous example changes its URL to _http://hostname/opendap/argos_, 
eliminating the need for the word servlet in the URL:

----
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>argos</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/argos</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>argos</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/argos/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----

//SHOULD THERE BE A LINK HERE? -ACP
For more on the <__servlet-mapping__> element see the 
Jakarta-Tomcat documentation.

==== <init-param> Elements

The OLFS uses <init-param> elements inside of each <servlet> element to
get specific configuration information.

The <init-param>s common to all OPeNDAP servlets are:

===== OLFSConfigFileName

This parameter identifies the name of the XML document file that
contains the OLFS configuration. This file must be located in the
persistent content directory and is typically called *olfs.xml*.

For example:

----
    <init-param>
    <param-name>OLFSConfigFileName</param-name>
    <param-value>olfs.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
----

===== DebugOn

This controls output to the terminal from which the servlet engine was
launched. The value is a list of flags that turn on debugging
instrumentation in different parts of the code. Supported values are:

* *probeRequest*: Prints a lengthy inspection of the HttpServletRequest 
object to stdout. *Note:* Do not leave this on for long or 
it will clog your Catalina logs.
* *DebugInterface*: Enables the server's debug interface. This
ineractive interface allows a user to look at (and change) the server
state via a web browser. *Note:* Enable this only for analysis purposes 
and disable when finshed.

For example:

----
    <init-param>
    <param-name>DebugOn</param-name>
    <param-value>probeRequest</param-value>
    </init-param>
----

_Default:_ If this parameter is not set or the value field is empty,
then these features will be disabled - which is what you want (unless
there is a problem to analyze).

==== Example of web.xml Content

----
<servlet>

    <servlet-name>hyrax</servlet-name>

    <servlet-class>opendap.coreServlet.DispatchServlet</servlet-class>

    <init-param>
        <param-name>DebugOn</param-name>
        <param-value></param-value>
    </init-param>

    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>

</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>hyrax</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>hyrax</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/hyrax</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>hyrax</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/hyrax/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----

=== Viewers Servlet (**viewers.xml** file)

The Viewers servlet provides, for each dataset, an HTML page containing
links to Java WebStart applications and to WebServices (such as WMS)
that can be utilized in conjunction with the dataset. The Viewers
servlet is configured via the contents of the *viewers.xml* file located
in the persistent content directory _$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap_.

==== *viewers.xml* Configuration File

===== Consists of

* *<JwsHandler>* Elements
* *<WebServiceHandler>* Elements

===== Example Configuration:

----
<ViewersConfig>
 
    <JwsHandler className="opendap.webstart.IdvViewerRequestHandler">
        <JnlpFileName>idv.jnlp</JnlpFileName>
    </JwsHandler>
 
    <JwsHandler className="opendap.webstart.NetCdfToolsViewerRequestHandler">
        <JnlpFileName>idv.jnlp</JnlpFileName>
    </JwsHandler>
 
    <JwsHandler className="opendap.webstart.AutoplotRequestHandler" />
 
    <WebServiceHandler className="opendap.viewers.NcWmsService" serviceId="ncWms" >
        <applicationName>Web Mapping Service</applicationName>
        <NcWmsService href="/ncWMS/wms" base="/ncWMS/wms" ncWmsDynamicServiceId="lds" />
    </WebServiceHandler>
 
    <WebServiceHandler className="opendap.viewers.GodivaWebService" serviceId="godiva" >
        <applicationName>Godiva WMS GUI</applicationName>
        <NcWmsService href="http://localhost:8080/ncWMS/wms" base="/ncWMS/wms" ncWmsDynamicServiceId="lds"/>
        <Godiva href="/ncWMS/godiva2.html" base="/ncWMS/godiva2.html"/>
    </WebServiceHandler>
 
</ViewersConfig>
----

=== Docs Servlet

The Docs (or documentation) servlet provides the OLFS web application
with the ability to serve a tree of static documentation files. By
default, it will serve the files in the documentation tree provided with
the OLFS in the Hyrax distribution. This tree is rooted at
_$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/docs/_ and contains documentation
pertaining to the software in the Hyrax distribution: installation and
configuration instruction, release notes, java docs, etc.

If one wishes to replace this information with one's own set of webpages, 
one can remove or replace the files in the default directory;
however, installing a new version of Hyrax will cause these files to be
overwritten after the install (and hopefully AFTER the new 
release documentation has been read and understood by the user).

The Docs servlet provides an alternative to this. If a _docs_ directory
is created in the _persistent content_ directory for Hyrax, the Docs
servlet will detect it when Tomcat is launched, and it will serve files
from there instead of from the default location.

This scheme provides 2 beneficial effects:

. It allows localizations of the web documents associated with Hyrax
to persist through Hyrax upgrades with no user intervention.
. It preserves important release documents that ship with the Hyrax
software.

In summary, to provide persistent web pages as part of a Hyrax
localization simple create the directory
_$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/**docs**_, 
Place your content in there and away you go. If you later wish to view
the web-based documentation bundled with Hyrax, simply change the name of
the directory from *docs* to something else and restart Tomcat (or 
look in the _$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/docs_ directory).

If a URL ends in a directory name or a "/" in the Docs servlet, then the
servlet will attempt to serve the *index.html* in that directory. In
other words *index.html* is the default document.

=== Logging

For information about logging, please check out the
<<logging-configuration, Hyrax Logging Configuration Documentation>>.

=== Authentication and Authorization

The following sub-sections detail authentication and authorization.

==== Apache Web Server (httpd)

If your organization desires secure access and authentication layers
for Hyrax, the recommended method is to use Hyrax in conjunction the
Apache Web Server (httpd).

Most organizations that utilize secure access and authentication for
their web presence are already doing so via Apache Web Server, and Hyrax
can be integrated nicely with this existing infrastructure.

More about integrating Hyrax with Apache Web Server can be found at
these pages:

* <<apache-integration, Integrating Hyrax with Apache Web Server>>
* <<user-authentication, Configuring Hyrax and Apache for User Authentication and 
Authorization>>

==== Tomcat

Hyrax may be used with the security features implemented by Tomcat for
authentication and authorization services.
We recommend that you read carefully and understand the Tomcat
security documentation.

For Tomcat 5.x see:

* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/index.html[Tomcat 5.x
Documentation]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/realm-howto.html[Section 6:
Configuring/Managing User Realms]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/ssl-howto.html[Section 12:
Configuring SSL]

For Tomcat 6.x see:

* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/index.html[Tomcat 6.x
Documentation]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/realm-howto.html[Section 6:
Configuring/Managing User Realms]
** http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[Section 12:
Configuring SSL]

We also recommend that you read chapter 12 of the
http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr154/index.html[Java
Servlet Specification 2.4] that decribes how to configure security
constraints at the web application level.

Tomcat security requires fairly extensive additions to the _web.xml_
file. (It is important to keep in mind that altering the <__servlet__>
definitions may render your Hyrax server inoperable - please see the
previous sections that discuss this.)

Examples of security content for the web.xml file can be found in the
persistent content directory of the Hyrax server, which by default is
located at __$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/__.

==== Limitations

Tomcat security officially supports _context_ level authentication. This
means that you can restrict access to the collection of servlets
running in a single web application (i.e. all of the stuff
that is defined in a single _web.xml_ file). You can call out different
authentication rules for different <__url-pattern__>s within the web
application, but only clients which do not cache ANY security
information will be able to easily access the different areas.

For example, in your _web.xml_ file you might have:

----
    <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
            <web-resource-name>fnoc1</web-resource-name>
            <url-pattern>/hyrax/nc/fnoc1.txt</url-pattern>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <role-name>fn1</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
 
    <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
             <web-resource-name>fnoc2</web-resource-name>
             <url-pattern>/hyrax/nc/fnoc2.txt</url-pattern>
         </web-resource-collection>
         <auth-constraint>
             <role-name>fn2</role-name>
          </auth-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
 
    <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        <realm-name>MyApplicationRealm</realm-name>
    </login-config>
----

Where the security roles fn1 and fn2 (defined in the *tomcat-users.xml*
file) have no common members.

The complete URI's would be:

----
http://localhost:8080/mycontext/hyrax/nc/fnoc1.txt
http://localhost:8080/mycontext/hyrax/nc/fnoc2.txt
----

This works for clients that do not cache anything; however, if you were 
to access these URLs with a typical browser, then once you had authenticated 
for one URI, you would be locked out of the other one until you 
successfully "reset" the browser by purging all caches.

This happens because, in the exchange between Tomcat and the
client, Tomcat sends the header 
`WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="MyApplicationRealm"`,
and the client authenticates. When the second URI is accessed, Tomcat
sends the the same authentication challenge with the same
`WWW-Authenticate` header. The client, having recently authenticated to
this _realm-name_ (defined in the <__login-config__> element in the
web.xml file - see above), resends the authentication information, and,
since it is not valid for that url pattern, the request is denied.

==== Persistence

You should be careful to back up your modified _web.xml_ file to a
location outside of the _$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap_ directory, as
newly installed versions of Hyrax will overwrite it. You could use an
_XML ENTITY_ and an _entity reference_ in the _web.xml_ to cause a local
file containing the security configuration to be included in the
web.xml. For example, add the __ENTITY__ 

[source,xml]
----
[<!ENTITY securityConfig SYSTEM "file:/fully/qualified/path/to/your/security/config.xml">]
----

to the _!DOCTYPE_ declaration at the top of the _web.xml_, and also
add an __entity reference__ (`&securityConfig;`) 
to the content of the _web-app_ element. This would cause your external
security configuration to be included in the _web.xml_ file.

._ENTITY_ configuration:
[source,xml]
----
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

    <!DOCTYPE web-app
        PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.2//EN"
        "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2_2.dtd"
        [<!ENTITY securityConfig      SYSTEM "file:/fully/qualified/path/to/your/security/config.xml">]
    >
    <web-app>

        <!--
            Loads a persistent security configuration from the content directory.
            This configuration may be empty, in which case no security constraints will be
            applied by Tomcat.
        -->
        &securityConfig;

        .
        .
        .

    </web-app>
----

This will not prevent you from losing your _web.xml_ file when a new
version of Hyrax is installed, but adding the _ENTITY_ to the new
_web.xml_ file would be easier than remembering an extensive security
configuration.

=== Compressed Responses and Tomcat

Many OPeNDAP clients accept compressed responses. This can greatly
increase the efficiency of the client/server interaction by diminishing
the number of bytes actually transmitted over "the wire." Tomcat
provides native compression support for the GZIP compression mechanism,
however it is NOT turned on by default.

The following example is based on Tomcat 5.15. We recommend that you 
carefully read the Tomcat documentation related to this topic before
proceeding:

* http://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat Home]
* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/index.html[Tomcat 5.x
documentation] (see Reference Section for the Apache Tomcat
Configuration section)
* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/http.html[Tomcat 5.x
documentation section related to compression]

==== Details

To enable compression, you will need to edit the
_$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml_ file. You will need to locate the
<__Connector__> element associated with your server; typically this will
be the only <__Connector__> element whose _port_ attribute is set equal
to 8080. You will need to add or change several of its attributes to
enable compression.

With our Tomcat 5.5 distribution, we found this default <__Connector__>
element definition in our _server.xml_ file:

----
    <Connector port="8080" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
        maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75";
        enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100"
        connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true"
        compression="no"
     >
----

You will need to add four attributes:

----
compression="force"
compressionMinSize="2048"
noCompressionUserAgents="gozilla, traviata"
compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,application/octet-stream"
----

Notice that there is a list of compressible MIME types. Basically:

* *compression="no"* means nothing gets compressed.
* *compression="yes"* means only the compressible MIME types get
compressed.
* *compression="force"* means everything gets compressed (assuming the
client accepts gzip and the response is bigger than compressionMinSize)

You MUST set *compression="force"* for compression to work with the
OPeNDAP data transport.

The final result being:

----
    <Connector port="8080" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
        maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75";
        enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100"
        connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true"
        compression="no"
        compression="force"
        compressionMinSize="2048"
        noCompressionUserAgents="gozilla, traviata"
        compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml,application/octet-stream"
     >
----

Restart Tomcat for these changes to take effect.

NOTE: If you are using Tomcat in conjunction with the Apache Web Server
(our friend httpd) via AJP you will need to also
<<apache-compressed-responses, configure Apache to deliver compressed responses>>
Tomcat will not compress content sent over the AJP connection.*
