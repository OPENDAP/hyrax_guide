1 What is OPeNDAP?
------------------

OPeNDAP provides a way for researchers to access scientific data
anywhere on the Internet from a wide variety of new _and existing_
programs.

The OPeNDAP architecture uses a client/server model, with a _client_
that sends requests for data out onto the network to some __server__,
that answers with the requested data. This is exactly the model used by
the http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html[World Wide Web]
where client browsers submit requests to web servers for the data that
make up web pages. Of course, OPeNDAP clients can do much more than
browse this data. Using flexible data types suitable for many uses,
including scientific data, the OPeNDAP servers deliver real data
directly to the client program in the format needed by that client.

OPeNDAP clients are very specialized browsers, constructed by linking
legacy data analysis programs with OPeNDAP-enabled versions of the data
access APIs they use, or by modifying the programs to use one of the
OPeNDAP data access APIs. In addition to providing a sophisticated set
of network-compatible APIs in several languages, there are also
libraries of legacy APIs available in OPeNDAP-aware versions. The
popular
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/guide.txn_toc.html[NetCDF]
library, for example, can read data from remote OPeNDAP data sources as
easily as it reads from a local file.

To expand the universe of data available to a user, OPeNDAP incorporates
a powerful data translation facility, so that data may be stored in data
structures and formats defined by the data provider, but accessed by the
user in a manner identical to the access of local data files on the
user's own system. Though there are limitations on the types of data
that may be translated (see
link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel#Translation[Translation]), the
facility is flexible and general enough to handle many of the possible
translations. There are two important results:

* A user may not need to know that data from one set are stored in a
format different from data in another set. Further, it may be possible
that _neither_ data set is stored in a format readable by the original
version of the data analysis and display program he or she uses.

* No segment of OPeNDAP users will be effectively cut off from accessing
data because of its storage format. A scientist who wishes to make his
or her data available to other OPeNDAP users may do so while keeping
that data in what may actually be a highly idiosyncratic storage format.
(Of course, it doesn't _have_ to be in a highly idiosyncratic format.)

The combination of the OPeNDAP network communication model and the data
translation facility make OPeNDAP a powerful tool for the retrieval,
sampling, and display of large distributed datasets. Though OPeNDAP was
developed by oceanographers, its application is not limited to
oceanographic data. The organizing principles and algorithms may be
applied to many other fields.

The uniformity with which data appears that makes the system so useful
for data analysis also eases automating data transport and manipulation
tasks. For example, NOAA's
http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/LAS/home/[Live Access Server (LAS)]
(see, for example, http://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/data.html) uses
OPeNDAP, as do many of the real-time observing systems that make up the
http://www.ioos.gov[Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS)], like the
http://gomoos.org[Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS)].

 +
 The population of people who may be interested in a system such as
OPeNDAP may be divided into data consumers and data providers. Though it
was an important observation to the development of OPeNDAP that the two
roles are often assumed by the same scientists, the division is a useful
one for the introduction of the system. The following two sections
provide a broad introduction to the roles of data consumer and data
provider. The remainder of this guide is organized around this
distinction between classes of users.

2 The OPeNDAP Client
--------------------

OPeNDAP uses a client/server model. The OPeNDAP servers are web servers
equipped to interpret an OPeNDAP URL sent to them. An OPeNDAP client
composes and sends messages to those servers. There are standalone
OPeNDAP clients, but most clients are constructed from data analysis
programs modified to get their data remotely, from the internet, rather
than locally, from a file.

Without OPeNDAP, an application program that uses one of the common data
access APIs such as netCDF will operate as shown in
../index.php/File:Unlinked.gif[the figure below]. The user makes a
request for data from the application program. This program uses some
data access API to read and write data. The program uses procedures
defined by that API to access the data, which is typically stored on the
same host machine. Some APIs are somewhat more sophisticated than this,
of course, but their general operation is as simple.

The Architecture of a Data Analysis Package

The operation of an OPeNDAP client is illustrated in the
../index.php/File:Unlinked.gif[figure below]. Here, the _same
application program_ that was used in ../index.php/File:Unlinked.gif[the
figure above] has been modified to use one of the OPeNDAP API libraries.
Now, in addition to being able to use local data as before, the
application program is able to access data from OPeNDAP servers anywhere
on the Internet in the same manner as the local data.

To make some analysis program into an OPeNDAP client, just re-link it
with the OPeNDAP API library. (Or, if your program uses one of the
supported legacy API libraries, like netCDF, you can link with the
OPeNDAP version of that library.) This will create a program that
accepts URLs as well as file pathnames to identify data to be read. (See
link:../index.php/UserGuideClient[the OPeNDAP Client]).

The Architecture of a Data Analysis Package Using OPeNDAP

 +
 OPeNDAP also provides a data translation facility. Data from the
original data file is translated by the OPeNDAP server into the OPeNDAP
data model for transmission to the client. Upon receiving the data, the
client translates the data into the
link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel[data model] it understands. Because
the data transmitted from an OPeNDAP server to the client travel in the
OPeNDAP format, the dataset's original storage format is completely
irrelevant to the client. If the client was originally designed to read
netCDF format files, the data returned by the OPeNDAP-netCDF library
will appear to have been read from a netCDF file, whatever the actual
format of the files from which the data were
read(link:../index.php?title=Wiki_Testing/OPeNDAPUserGuideFootNotes&action=edit&redlink=1[4]).
If the program expects JGOFS data, the OPeNDAP-JGOFS library will return
data that seem to have come from a JGOFS dataset, and so on.

OPeNDAP does not pretend to remove all the overhead of data searches. A
user will still have to keep track of the URLs of interesting data in
the same way a user must now keep track of the names of files. (You may
run across datasets where the data consists of OPeNDAP URLs. These are
the OPeNDAP file servers, and have been developed by OPeNDAP users to
organize datasets consisting of large numbers of individual files.) But
it does make the access to that data simpler and quicker.

The OPeNDAP group provides a whole array of client software to implement
this communication standard. These range from standalone clients to
libraries to link with existing software. There is more about these in
link:../index.php?title=UserGuideOPeNDAPClient&action=edit&redlink=1[OPeNDAP
Client].

3 The OPeNDAP Services
----------------------

The communication between an OPeNDAP client and server is specified by
the Data Access Protocol (DAP). This defines the range of messages a
server must understand and the kinds of replies it makes.

There are two categories of messages an OPeNDAP server can understand.
Some are required by the DAP, and others are merely suggested. A server
is considered to be DAP-compliant if it can respond intelligibly to the
required messages.

The requests messages a server is required to understand are these:

Data Description ::
  Data values come in types and sizes. An array, for example, might
  consist of 10 integers. The value "ten" and the type "integer"
  describe the array. This request returns information about data types,
  so that a receiving program can allocate space appropriately. See
  link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel#DDS[Data Description Structure
  (DDS)].

Data Attribute ::
  This is a request to provide information _about_ data, and typically
  includes information like units, names of data types, reference
  information and so on. See
  link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel#DAS[Data Attribute Structure
  (DAS)].

Data ::
  The server also must be able to respond to a request for the data
  itself. See link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel#DataDDS[data
  response].

A server may respond to requests like these, too:

ASCII ::
  Some servers can convert data to ASCII values on the fly. This allows
  users to view data using a standard web browser, assuming the data are
  not too large. See link:../index.php/UserGuideServer#ASCII[ASCII
  return].

Info ::
  The info response is a formatted page containing information from the
  Data Attributes and Data Description responses. It's meant to be a
  human-readable way to show what's available in a dataset via a
  standard web browser. See link:../index.php/UserGuideServer#Info[Info
  response].

HTML ::
  Very similar to the info response is the HTML response. This provides
  not only the information from the info response, but also includes a
  Javascript form to help you build a request for data from the same
  data file. The best description of the HTML form is in the
  link:../index.php/QuickStart[Quick Start Guide].

SOAP ::
  OPeNDAP servers can provide their data in terms of a SOAP request and
  response. For more information see
  link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel#SOAP[SOAP Request].

DDX ::
  The DDX is an XML version of the Data Attribute and Data Description
  replies. See link:../index.php/UserGuideServer#DDX[DDX Request].

4 The OPeNDAP Server
--------------------

OPeNDAP provides a definition of the communication between client and
server. Servers and clients who conform to that standard can communicate
with each other. In addition to the OPeNDAP communication standard
itself, the OPeNDAP group also provides an implementation of that
standard server protocol, called _Hyrax._

The OPeNDAP data server is made up of two pieces. You can think of them
as a front-end and a back-end, though a client will not be aware of the
separation. They will often be run on the same machine, and even when
they are not, a client will see only the front end.

The front-end server is a Tomcat servlet, and is also called the
*OPeNDAP Lightweight Front-End Servlet* (OLFS). Its job is to receive
your request for data and manage all the different forms such a request
might take. For example, you might be asking for the data, an ASCII
version of the data, or a reply to a SOAP message looking for data. The
front-end server can also reply to THREDDS catalog requests, for
information about the data, and can directly provide some information
about the data, too.

The *Back-End Server* (BES) is more strictly about performance, and is
designed to respond quickly and efficiently to requests from the OLFS.
It is a pure data server, and has only one format of request and
response, relying on the OLFS to convert messages to whatever format
will accommodate the user. Most users won't make requests directly to
the BES.

../index.php/File:HyraxArchitecture.jpg[image:../images/thumb/c/c5/HyraxArchitecture.jpg/600px-HyraxArchitecture.jpg[HyraxArchitecture.jpg]]

_Hyrax_ is an alternative name for the OPeNDAP 4 Data Server.

See link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel[Data Model] for a description
of the data returned by these requests and see
link:../index.php/UserGuideServer[OPeNDAP Server] for a description of
the URL syntax used to send these requests.

See link:../index.php/Hyrax[the OPeNDAP 4 Data Server documentation] for
a description of how to install and configure an OPeNDAP data server
(Hyrax).

5 Administration and Centralization of Data
-------------------------------------------

Under OPeNDAP, there is no central archive of data. Data under OPeNDAP
is organized in a manner similar to the World Wide Web itself. That is,
all one need do to make one's data available is to start up a properly
configured server on an Internet node that has access to the data to be
served. Each data provider is free to join and to leave the system when
it is convenient, just as any proprietor of a web page is free to delete
it or add to it as whimsy demands.

Of course, as can also be seen on the World Wide Web, there are some
disadvantages to the lack of central authority. If no one knows about a
web site, no one will visit it. Similarly, listing a dataset in a
central data catalog, such as the Global Change Master Directory
(http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov[http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/]),can make data
available to other researchers in a way that simply configuring an
OPeNDAP server does not. OPeNDAP provided a facility for registering a
data set with the GCMD catalog, which makes the data set known to the
OPeNDAP data location service. The THREDDS catalog service is another
way to make information about your data widely available.

 The remainder of this book will be divided into three major sections:
instructions on the building and operating of OPeNDAP clients; a
tutorial and reference on running OPeNDAP servers and making data
available to OPeNDAP clients; and technical documentation describing the
implementation details (and the motivation behind many of the design
decisions) of the OPeNDAP software.
