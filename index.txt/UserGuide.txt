From OPeNDAP Documentation

OPeNDAP provides a way to easily share science data across the internet.
It is used widely in earth-science research settings, but is not limited
to that. Using a flexible data model and a well-defined transmission
format, an OPeNDAP client can request data from a wide variety of
OPeNDAP servers, allowing researchers to enjoy flexibility similar to
the flexibility of the web.

This guide introduces the important concepts behind the OPeNDAP data
model and transmission format, as well as the clients and servers that
use them. It is not a reference for any particular client or server,
though you will find links to that documentation within its chapters.

link:../index.php/UserGuideIntroduction[Introduction] ::
  A look at the transmission format, the services provided by the
  OPeNDAP servers, and the advantages of using OPeNDAP. All users will
  find it helpful to read this.

link:../index.php/UserGuideDataModel[Data Model] ::
  A review of the data types OPeNDAP sends between client and server and
  issues involved in translating one to another. Researchers who will be
  using OPeNDAP to transfer data may find this useful.

link:../index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages[OPeNDAP Messages] ::
  A closer look at the messages passed to and from an OPeNDAP server and
  the various services that may be provided. Also reviews constraint
  expressions, which can be used to select data from specific datasets.
  Researchers who will use OPeNDAP to get data for analysis will find
  this useful.

link:../index.php/UserGuideServer[The OPeNDAP Server] ::
  The structure of the OPeNDAP server, including a closer look at the
  server software provided by the OPeNDAP group itself. People involved
  in providing data to OPeNDAP users should read this before looking at
  the documentation for the server they will install.

link:../index.php/UserGuideClient[The OPeNDAP Client] ::
  The parts of the OPeNDAP client, including a review of the available
  client software, from within as well as outside the OPeNDAP group.
  Developers interested in creating new OPeNDAP clients, as well as
  users who want to convert a program to a network-aware OPeNDAP client
  should read this chapter.
