1 The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler
--------------------------------------

The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler is a OPeNDAP server add-on that
uses OPeNDAP FreeForm ND to convert and serve data in formats that are
not directly supported by existing link:../index.php/Hyrax[Hyrax] data
handlers. Bringing OPeNDAP FreeForm ND 's data conversion capacity into
the OPeNDAP world widens data access for DAP2 clients, since any format
that can be described in OPeNDAP FreeForm ND can now be served by the
OPeNDAP data server.

Like all DAP2 servers, the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler responds to
client requests for data by returning either data values or information
about the data. It differs from other DAP2 servers because it invokes
OPeNDAP FreeForm ND to read the data from disk before serving it to the
client.

The following sequence of steps illustrates how the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND
Data Handler works:

 +

1.  A DAP2 client sends a request for data to a OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data
Handler . The request must include the name of the file that contains
the data, and may include a constraint expression to sample the data.
2.  The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler looks in its path for two
files: a data file with the name sent by the client, and a format
definition file to use with the data file. The format definition file
contains a description of the data format, constructed according to the
OPeNDAP FreeForm ND syntax.
3.  The server uses both files in invoking the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND
engine. The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND engine reads the data file and the
format file, using the instructions in the latter to convert the former
into data which is then passed back to the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data
Handler .
4.  On receiving the converted data, the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data
Handler converts the data into the DAP2 transmission format. The
conversion may involve some adjustment of data types; these are listed
below. The server also applies any constraint expressions the client
sent along with the URL.
5.  The server then constructs DDS and DAS files based on the format of
the converted data. If the server has access to DDS and DAS files that
describe the data, it applies those definition before sending them back
to the client.
6.  Finally, the server sends the DDS, DAS, and converted data back to
the client.

For information about how to write a OPeNDAP FreeForm ND data
description, refer to the link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/tblfmt[Table
Format] for sequence data and
link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/arrayfmt[Array Format] for array data.

The Opendap User Guide.

1.1 Differences between OPeNDAP FreeForm ND and the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND
Data Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler is based on the same libraries used
to make the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND utilities. However, there are some
important differences in the resulting software:

* The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler is a OPeNDAP FreeForm ND
application that converts data __on receiving a client request for that
data__, and not before. Data served by the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data
Handler remains in its original format.
* The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler does not produce an output file
containing the converted data, but serves it directly over the network
to the DAP2 client. Therefore, the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler
ignores the output section of the format definition file.
* To sample a data file, you do not write format definitions that cause
the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND engine to sample the data file. Instead, you add
a DAP2 "constraint expression" to the URL that the client sends to the
OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler .
* The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler performs data conversion on the
fly. Conversion only takes place when the client sends a URL requesting
data from the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler .
* Unlike OPeNDAP FreeForm ND , there is no static file created by the
conversion.

(If you wish to create or work with such a file, use the OPeNDAP
FreeForm ND utilities, such as newform.)

1.2 Data Type Conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler performs data conversions, based on
the data it receives from the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND engine. Note that
OPeNDAP does not recommend the use of int64 and uint64 in the format
definition file.

 +

DAP2 Data Type Conversions

[cols=",",options="header",]

|*OPeNDAP FreeForm ND* |*DAP2*

|int8, uint8 |Byte
|int16 |Int16
|int32, int64 |Int32

1.2.1 Conversion Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The examples show how the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler treats data
received from the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND engine. Please see the OPeNDAP
FreeForm ND Data Handler distribution for more test data and format
definition files, and the (link:../index.php/Wiki_Testing/tblfmt[Table
Format]) for more information on writing format definitions.

 +

1.2.1.1 Arrays
++++++++++++++

If you define a variable as an array in the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND format
definition file, the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler produces an array
of variables with matching types.

For exmple, this entry in the format definition file:

----------------------------------------------
binary_input_data "array"
fvar1 1 4 ARRAY["records" 1 to 101] of int32 0
----------------------------------------------

in converted by the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler to:

--------------------------
Int32 fvar1[records = 101]
--------------------------

 +

1.2.1.2 Collections of Variables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you define several variables in the format definition file, the
OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler produces a Sequence of variables with
matching types.

For example, this entry in the format definition file:

-----------------------------
ASCII_input_data "ASCII_data"
fvar1   1 10  int32 2
svar1  13 18  int16 0
usvar1 21 26 uint16 1
lvar1  29 39  int32 0
ulvar1 42 52 uint32 4
-----------------------------

is converted by the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler to:

-------------
Sequence {
Int32 fvar1;
Int32 svar1;

...
} ASCII_data;
-------------

 +

1.2.1.3 Multiple Arrays
+++++++++++++++++++++++

If you define a collection of arrays in the format definition file, as
you would expect, the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler produces a
dataset containing multiple arrays.

For example, this entry in the format definition file:

----------------------------------------------
binary_input_data "arrays"
fvar1 1 4 ARRAY["records" 1 to 101] of int32 0
fvar2 1 4 ARRAY["records" 1 to 101] of int32 0
----------------------------------------------

is converted by the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler to:

------------------------
Dataset {
Int32 fvar1[records=101]
Int32 fvar2[records=101]
};
------------------------
