1 Error Handling
----------------

The FreeForm ND error handling system captures errors, such as improper
usage, code problems, and system errors, and places them in an error
queue. For each error captured, error type and a short message are
placed in the message queue. If a fatal error occurs, the program stops
executing and displays all error messages in the queue.

1.1 Error Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a list of some possible error messages with suggestions
for corrections.

 Problem opening, reading, or writing to file ::
  Check that all file names and paths are correct.
 Problem making format ::
  Make sure there is a format file describing the data file formats.
  Check that input and output format descriptions in the format file
  accurately describe the data.
 Problem making header format ::
  If a header exists in the data file, it must be described in a format
  file. Check that the header description accurately describes the
  header in your data file.
 Problem getting value ::
 Problem processing variable list ::
  The data formats may not be described correctly or there may be some
  inconsistencies in the data. Check also for unprintable characters at
  the end of the data file.
 File length / Record length mismatch ::
 Record Length or CR Problem ::
  This usually happens because the input format description is not
  correct. Make sure the format description's last position is the last
  character before the end-of-line character. If you have a header, make
  sure it is described correctly. The header's length must include all
  characters up until the last end-of-line-character before the data
  begins.
 Binary Overflow ::
  Try using a larger output variable type such as a long instead of a
  short. Be sure you have given enough space for the values to be
  written. See Chapter for more information.
 Variable not found ::
  The variable names in your output format must match the variable names
  in the input format unless you are using conversion variables.
 Data Overflow ::
  Data overflow does not usually cause a fatal error and FreeForm ND
  functions try to anticipate them. If overflow occurs for a particular
  value, ***'s are written to that value's location. If you find these
  in your output, check your variable positions and precision. Increase
  field width or use a "larger" data type. Be sure the output format
  specifies space for the output variable. For instance, FreeForm ND
  adds a leading zero in front of decimal points. If the original data
  did not have a leading zero, the output will have one more digit than
  the input.
 Insufficient memory allocation ::
  The application has run out of memory. Try using the -b (local buffer
  size) option, or modify autoexec.bat and config.sys and comment out
  devices, TSR's, etc.
