== BES Configuration Introduction ==

Building the BES and its data handlers from source (or installing from
the Linux RPMs) will provide the default installation with data and a
valid configuration. This is suitable for testing. The following details
how you go about customizing it for your data.

=== Location of the BES Configuation File ===

The BES configuration file is called _bes.conf_ and can be found in
_$prefix/etc/bes/_ if you built the software from source or in
_/etc/bes/_ if you used our RPM packages. By default _$prefix_ is in
_/usr/local_.

=== Basic format of parameters ===

Parameters set in the BES configuration file have the following format:

----
Name=Value
----

If you wish to add to the value of a parameter, then you would use +=
instead of =

----
Name=Value1
Name+=Value2
----

The above would return the values Value1 and Value2 in the software.

And if you would like to include another configuration file you would
use the following:

----
BES.Include=/path/to/configuration/file/blee.conf
----

The bes.conf file includes all .conf files in the modules directory with
the following:

----
BES.Include=modules/.*\.conf$
----

*Note:* Regular expressions can be used in the _Include_ parameter to
match a set of files.

=== Administration & Logging

In the bes.conf file, the _BES.ServerAdministrator_
parameter is the address used in various mail messages returned to
clients. Set this so that the email's recipient will be able to fix
problems and/or respond to user questions. Also set the log file and log
level. If the _BES.LogName_ is set to a relative path, it will be treated
as relative to the directory where the BES is started. (That is, if the
BES is installed in _/usr/local/bin_ but you start it in your home
directory using the parameter value below, the log file will be
_bes.log_ in your home directory.)

----
BES.ServerAdministrator=webmaster@some.place.edu
BES.LogName=./bes.log
BES.LogVerbose=no
----

Because the BES is a server in its own right, you will need to tell it
which network port and interface to use. Assuming you are running the
BES and OLFS (i.e., all of Hyrax) on one machine, do the following:

==== User and Group Parameters ====

In the bes.conf file, the BES must be started as root. One
of the things that the BES does first is to start a listener that
listens for requests to the BES. This listener is started as root, but
then the _User_ and _Group_ of the process is set using parameters in the
BES configuration file:

----
BES.User=user_name
BES.Group=group_name
----

You can also set these to a user id and a group id. For example:

----
BES.User=#172
BES.Group=#14
----

==== Setting the Networking Parameters

In the bes.conf configuration file, we have settings for how the BES
should listen for requests:

----
BES.ServerPort=10022
# BES.ServerUnixSocket=/tmp/opendap.socket
----

The _BES.ServerPort_ tells the BES which TCP/IP port to use when
listening for commands. Unless you need to use a different port, use the
default. Ports with numbers less than 1024 are special, otherwise you
can use any number under 65536. That being said, stick with the default unless
you know you need to change it.

// Is this line commented or commented out?
In the default bes.conf file we have commented the _ServerUnixSocket_
parameter, which disables I/O over that device. If you need
UNIX socket I/O, uncomment this line, otherwise leave it commented.
The fewer open network I/O ports, the easier it is to make sure the
server is secure.

If both _ServerPort_ and _ServerUnixSocket_ are defined, the BES listens
on both the TCP port and the Unix Socket. Local clients on the same
machine as the BES can use the unix socket for a faster connection.
Otherwise, clients on other machines will connect to the BES using the
_BES.ServerPort_ value.

NOTE: The OLFS always uses only the TCP socket, even if the UNIX 
socket is present.

=== Debugging Tip

In _bes.conf_, use the _BES.ProcessManagerMethod_
parameter to control whether the BES acts like a normal Unix server.
The default value of `multiple` causes the BES to accept many
connections at once, like a typical server. The value `single` causes it
to accept a single connection (process the commands sent to it and exit),
greatly simplifying troubleshooting.

----
BES.ProcessManagerMethod=multiple
----

==== Controlling how compressed files are treated

Compression parameters are configured in the bes.conf configuration
file.

//The _bz2_, _gz_, and _Z_ file compression methods are understood by the BES.
//The above line seems like a repetition of the below.
The BES will automatically recognize compressed files using the _bz2_,
_gzip_, and Unix compress (_Z_) compression schemes. However, you need to
configure the BES to accept these file types as valid data by making
sure that the filenames are associated with a data handler. For
example, if you're serving netCDF files, you would set
`BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch` so that it includes
`nc:.*\.(nc|NC)(\.gz|\.bz2|\.Z)?$;`. The first part of the regular
expression must match both the filename and the '.nc' extension, and the second
part must match the suffix, indicating the file is compressed (either _.gz_,
_.bz2_ or _.Z_).

When the BES is asked to serve a file that has been compressed, it first
must decompress it before passing it to the correct data handler (except
for those formats which support 'internal' compression, such as HDF4).
The _BES.CacheDir_ parameter tells the BES where to store the
uncompressed file. Note that the default value of _/tmp_ is probably less
safe than a directory that is used only by the BES for this purpose.
You might, for example, want to set this to `<prefix>/var/bes/cache`.

The _BES.CachePrefix_ parameter is used to set a prefix for the cached
files so that when a directory like /tmp is used, it is easy for the BES
to recognize which files are its responsibility.

The _BES.CacheSize_ parameter sets the size of the cache in megabytes.
When the size of the cached files exceeds this value, the cache will be
purged using a least-recently-used approach, where the file's access time is the
'use time'. Because it is usually impossible to determine the
sizes of data files before decompressing them, there may be times when
the cache holds more data than this value. Ideally this value should be
several times the size of the largest file you plan to serve.

[[Loading_Modules]]
==== Loading Software Modules

Virtually all of the BES's functions are contained in modules that are
loaded when the server starts up. Each module is a shared-object
library. The configuration for each of these modules is contained in its
own configuration file and is stored in a directory called _modules_.
This directory is located in the same directory as the bes.conf file:
_$prefix/etc/bes/modules/_.

By default, all .conf files located in the modules are loaded by the BES
per this parameter in the bes.conf configuration file:

----
BES.Include=modules/.*\.conf$
----

So, if you don't want one of the modules to be loaded, simply change its
name to, say, nc.conf.sav and it won't be loaded.

For example, if you are installing the general purpose server module
(the dap-server module) then a dap-server.conf file will be installed in
the _modules_ directory. Also, most installations will include the dap
module, allowing the BES to serve OPeNDAP data. This configuration file,
called dap.conf, is also included in the _modules_ directory. For a
data handler, say netcdf, there will be an nc.conf file located in the
modules directory.

Each module should contain within it a line that tells the BES to
load the module at startup:

----
BES.modules+=nc
BES.module.nc=/usr/local/lib/bes/libnc_module.so
----

Module specific parameters will be included in its own configuration
file. For example, any parameters specific to the netcdf data handler
will be included in the _nc.conf_ file.

[[Pointing_to_data]]
==== Pointing to data

There are two parameters that can be used to tell the BES where your
data are stored. Which one you use depends on whether you are setting up
the BES to work as part of Hyrax (and thus with THREDDS catalogs) or as
a standalone server. In either case, set the value of the
_.RootDirectory_ parameter to point to the root directory of your data
files (only one may be specified). If the BES is being used as part of Hyrax, 
use _BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory_ in dap.conf, which is stored 
in the _modules_ directory; otherwise, use _BES.Data.RootDirectory_ in bes.conf itself. 
So, if you are setting up Hyrax, set the value of 
_BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory_ but be *sure* to set _BES.Data.RootDirectory_ 
to some value or the BES will not start.

In bes.conf set the following:

----
BES.Data.RootDirectory=/full/path/data/root/directory
----

Also in bes.conf set the following if using Hyrax (usually the case):

----
BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory=/full/path/data/root/directory
----

By default, the _RootDirectory_ parameters are set to point to the test
data supplied with the data handlers.

Next, configure the mapping between data source names and data handlers.
This is usually taken care of for you already, so you probably won't
have to set this parameter. Each data handler module (_netcdf_, _hdf4_,
_hdf5_, _freeform_, etc...) will have this set depending on the extension of
the data files for the data.

For example, in nc.conf, for the netcdf data handler module, you'll find
the line:

----
BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch+=nc:.*\.nc(\.bz2|\.gz|\.Z)?$;
----

When the BES is asked to perform some commands on a particular data
source, it uses regular expressions to figure out which data handler
should be used to carry out the commands. The value of the
_BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch_ parameter holds the set of regular
expressions. The value of this parameter is a list of handlers and
expressions in the form handler _expression;_. Note that these regular
expressions are like those used by `grep` on Unix and are somewhat
cryptic, but once you see the pattern it's not that bad. Below, the
_TypeMatch_ parameter is being told the following:

* Any data source with a name that ends in `.nc` should be handled by 
the _nc_ (netcdf) handler (see _BES.module.nc_ above)
* Any file with a `.hdf`, `.HDF` or `.eos` suffix should be processed 
using the HDF4 handler (note that case matters)
* Data sources ending in `.dat` should use the FreeForm handler

Here's the one for the hdf4 data handler module:

----
BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch+=h4:.*\.(hdf|HDF|eos)(\.bz2|\.gz|\.Z)?$;
----

And for the FreeForm handler:

----
BES.Catalog.catalog.TypeMatch+=ff:.*\.dat(\.bz2|\.gz|\.Z)?$;
----

If you fail to configure this correctly, the BES will return error
messages stating that the type information has to be provided. It won't 
tell you this, however when it starts, only when the OLFS (or some other
software) makes a data request. This is because it is possible
to use BES commands in place of these regular expressions, although the
Hyrax won't.

==== Including and Excluding files and directories

Finally, you can configure the types of information that the BES sends
back when a client requests catalog information. The _Include_ and
_Exclude_ parameters provide this mechanism, also using a list of
regular expressions (with each element of the list separated by a
semicolon). In the example below, files that begin with a dot are
excluded. These parameters are set in the dap.conf configuration file.

The _Include_ expressions are applied to the node first, followed by the
_Exclude_ expressions. For collections of nodes, only the Exclude
expressions are applied.

----
BES.Catalog.catalog.Include=;
BES.Catalog.catalog.Exclude=^\..*;
----

==== Symbolic Links

If you would like symbolic links to be followed when retrieving data
and for viewing catalog entries, then you need to set the following two
parameters: the _BES.FollowSymLinks_ parameter and the _BES.RootDirectory_
parameter. The _BES.FollowSymLinks_ parameter is for non-catalog
containers and is used in conjunction with the _BES.RootDirectory_
parameter. It is *not* a general setting. The
_BES.Catalog.catalog.FollowSymLinks_ is for catalog requests and data
containers in the catalog. It is used in conjunction with the
_BES.Catalog.catalog.RootDirectory_ parameter above. The default is set
to _No_ in the installed configuration file. To allow for symbolic links
to be followed you need to set this to _Yes_.

The following is set in the bes.conf file:

----
BES.FollowSymLinks=No|Yes
----

And this one is set in the dap.conf file in the modules directory:

----
BES.Catalog.catalog.FollowSymLinks=No|Yes
----

==== Parameters for Specific Handlers

Parameters for specific modules can be added to the BES configuration
file for that specific module. No module-specific parameters should be
added to bes.conf.
