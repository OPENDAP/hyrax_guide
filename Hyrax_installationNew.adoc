= Installation requirements

We have adopted +++ C++-14 +++ as aggressively as we can, resulting in fewer lines of code, better memory management and more efficient code. Now require ++C++-14++ to build the code.

The OLFS now uses Java17 (jdk17).

Hyrax is now build on RHEL8 (Rocky8). This means we have removed support for RHEL 7 (CentOS 7) and CentOS 6.
