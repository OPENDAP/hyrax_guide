== Create Earthdata Application

. In your browser, navigate to your Earthdata login profile page, 
which will be either `uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile` or
`urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile`, depending on whether 
you are using the production or the test service.

. In the menubar, click on the _Applications_ dropdown and select 
 _My Applications_ from the list of options:

+
WARNING: If you don't see the _My Applications_ option, then you
need to contact your Earthdata Login administrator to request 
Application Creator permission on their system.

. On the _My Applications_ page, click the _CREATE A NEW APPLICATION_ button:

. Fill out and submit the form:

. Return to the _My Applications Page_ to view the application that you just created:
+

The application may show as _Pending_, or it may immediately 
become _Active_; regardless, once your application registration request
passes through the approval process, its status will be changed
to _Active_. You should get two emails, one acknowledging your
application registration and another indicating that your
application has been activated. (In the past, it has taken 
about twenty minutes to receive the activation notification.)

== Approve Newly Created Earthdata Login Application

Once your application is marked as _Active_, you will need to 
approve it so that the Earthdata Login system knows that you 
are okay with the application having access to your Earthdata Login
user profile information (not your password).

NOTE: Every single Earthdata Login user that is going to access your new server will need to do this too.

. In the menubar, click on the _Applications_ dropdown and select
_Authorized Apps_ from the list of options.

. Click the _APPROVE MORE APPLICATIONS_ button:

. On the following page (titled _Approve Applications_), enter the
name of the application you previously created, and click the
_SEARCH_ button:

. When you have located the application you would like to approve,
click the _APPROVE_ button to its right:

You will be returned to the _Approved Applications_ page, where you
should see a green confirmation banner at the top of the page
and your newly-approved application in the list of approved apps.
