1 Introduction
--------------

We have used the VMware platform for our virtual machines (VM) and thus
our VMs will run under any of their hypervisors. We choose VMware
because they provide a good balance of support for Linux and Windows XP
hypervisors that can be used to serve data as well as hypervisors for
Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux for use in a workshop environment. In all
but the Mac OS/X case, there is a hypervisor available for free and the
OS/X 'Fusion' hypervisor can be used for 30 days without charge.

The following describes using the Hyrax/VM both as a way to serve data
and as a pedagogical tool in a workshop. To use the Hyrax/VM to serve
data you will need to have the data online and be able to install and
run either the VMware Server or ESX hypervisor. In all likelihood, you
will need to be conversant with the host OS running on the machine where
the data reside and also have moderate knowledge of computer networking,
firewall configuration and sharing disks on a LAN. In other words you
will need basic system administration skills. A familiarity with
Linux/Unix, and Ubuntu Linux in particular, will also be very useful
since that is the operating system used by the VMs.

To run the Hyrax/VM as part of a workshop the general requirements are
much more easily met. You need to be able to install software, follow
the directions that come with the VMware Player, Workstation or Fusion
hypervisor and then proceed on with the workshop agenda.

This work was sponsored by a grant from NASA and a description of how
the VMs were built can be found at
link:../index.php/CheapStix[CheapStix].

../index.php/User:Jimg[jimg] 10:10, 12 February 2009 (PST) The
link:../index.php/CheapStix[CheapStix] article has some important
information for new users of the VM:

1.  Sometimes, for an unknown reason, the network interfaces come up
hosed. The symptom is that networking is not working and that _ifconfig
-a_ does not show _eth0_ in an _UP_ state. When you login to the VM and
run _ifconfig -a_ you should see, in addition to some other stuff, the
word _UP_ next to __eth0__. If not, follow the advice for the _udev
hack_ on the link:../index.php/CheapStix[CheapStix] page.

1.1 Technical Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Virtual Machine (VM) is “an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real
machine” (Popek, Gerald J. and Robert P. Goldberg. “Formal Requirements
for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures.” Communications of the
ACM. Vol.17 No.7. July 1974).

*  The ‘isolated duplicate’ is typically a data file or collection of
files which contain the information needed to emulate the RAM, spinning
disks and other hardware elements of the VM. If you look inside the
_.zip_ files we use to hold our Hyrax/VM distributions, you will see
they contain a number of files and those have names that indicate which
hold the RAM, Processor state and disk memory of the VM.
*  The information in the files is used by a virtual machine monitor or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor[hypervisor] to instantiate the
VM.
*  Once running, the VM is indistinguishable from a ‘real’ computer in
many ways.

There are two broad classes of hypervisors: Native and Hosted. A native
(or type one) hypervisor runs on ‘bare metal’ while a hosted (or type
two) hypervisor runs within an operating system. _Later in this Guide we
discuss using both type one and two hypervisors to serve data using the
Hyrax/VM. For a workshop environment, only the type two (or hosted)
hypervisor makes sense since the attendees will all be running the
Hyrax/VM on their laptop computers._

There are a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_virtual_machines[large number
of VM systems]. Note that virtual machine language interpreters (e.g.,
Java) are not considered part of this set of software.

1.1.1 Why use virtualization?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Benefits:

* Isolation. It is easy to ensure that software in one VM will be
unaffected by problems in another, even when they run on the same
hardware and/or hypervisor.
*  Legacy software. One real computer running a hypervisor can runs a
suite of virtual machines, each tailored to the needs of various legacy
software packages.
*  Scalability. VMs provide some interesting possibilities in situations
where it is important to be able to add and subtract new hosts from a
network. Examples include Internet Service Providers and Cloud Computing
environments.

_We are using VMs primarily for the first two reasons: We want to
provide a way to run our servers within a hypervisor because we fell
that is an important option to provide larger groups who need to meet
strict security requirements and because we want to support data
providers who are using Windows operating systems. In the later case we
can develop our software for the Linux/Unix operating systems (which are
not really legacy systems...) and then us a VM and hypervisor to run
them on the Windows platforms._

Downsides:

*  Efficiency. It is less efficient, although how much so varies widely
among different implementations. If many aspects of the underlying
hardware and the VM hardware are the same, the hypervisor can be very
efficient.
*  Complexity. With many computers (virtual or not) comes a larger
system administration burden. This can manifest itself in several ways
including increased network complexity and the need to take into account
the idiosyncrasies of different VMs.

2 Using the Hyrax and Virtual Machine to server data
----------------------------------------------------

Using the Hyrax and Virtual Machine (VM) software combination in a
production environment is hard to describe in a completely general way
since each such environment will have its own unique characteristics.
However, there are several common cases that we will cover here along
with some basic choices about additional infrastructure you'll need to
add to your computer(s). You'll need to select a hypervisor within which
the VM will run and you'll need to determine how that VM will gain
access to your data.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To understand more about the construction of the VM, see
link:../index.php/CheapStix[CheapStix] where the process used to build
the Ubuntu JeOS VM is described in detail.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.1 Choosing a hypervisor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to serve data you will need to use either the
http://www.vmware.com/products/server/[VMware Server] or
http://www.vmware.com/products/vi/esx/[ESX] hypervisor since these allow
incoming network connections to be made with servers running in VMs
hosted by the hypervisor. The _Server_ hypervisor is available for free
while the _ESX_ hypervisor costs money. For many uses _Server_ is likely
adequate in terms of performance and is almost certainly simpler to
configure. You should be able to install it on a typical Linux or
Windows computer in less than an hour. Choose _Server_ if you need to
get a server up on a Windows XP host or if ease of configuration and
maintenance are more important than maximum performance. However, the
_ESX_ hypervisor is the faster option. If you are using the Hyrax/VM
combination as part of a security policy that requires the server to be
isolated from the data and other network services, then you should
consider this option. Lastly, the _ESX_ hypervisor is part of VMware's
http://www.vmware.com/products/vi/[Virtual Infrastructure] and if
performance is a major concern then you should probably research that as
well.

|=======================================================================
|Hypervisor |Cost |Environment |Complexity |Performance
|VMware Server |Free |Windows XP or Linux |Low (< 1 hour to install)
|Modest (Some overhead w/host OS)

|VMware ESX |$ |Bare Intel Hardware |High (Requires new Intel hardware)
|High (No host OS overhead)
|=======================================================================

2.2 Data access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next choice you must make is how the server (Hyrax) will access the
data it serves. One very limited option is to store the data in the
virtual machine. This is limited for two reasons. First the data will
need to be copied to the VM and copying data is often very undesirable
because data volumes are high and because now two copies of the data
must be maintained. In addition, the size of the VM has been kept small
so that running it imposes the minimum load on the host.

A second option is to store that data on a different computer and access
the files using a networked file system. This is really the only viable
option for most cases - there's usually just too much data to copy it on
the VM disks. If you are using Linux to store the data, then use NFS to
export the file system as read only and use NFS to mount the file system
on the VM. Similarly, if your host OS is Windows XP, use the XP _Shared
Folder_ to make the data/file system available and then use Samba on the
VM to mount it.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_We don't include both NFS and Samba on the Hyrax/VM because we wanted
to load only those packages needed and clearly, only one of these is
necessary for the vast majority of cases._
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.2.1 General steps for serving data using a VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Load the hypervisor on the Host computer
2.  Copy the Virtual machine to the host and store it where the
hypervisor can access it.
3.  Start the hypervisor and the VM and verify that both are working.
4.  Export the data to be served from the Host computer (or any other
computer)
5.  Mount the data within the VMs file system
6.  Make any configuration changes needed to Hyrax to serve the new data
7.  Start Hyrax and verify correct operation.

2.2.2 Detailed example: Serving data from an XP host using the
Ubuntu-based VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example details the steps I used to serve data from a virtual
machine using the Ubuntu 8.04 JeOS, Hyrax 1.4.2, Tomcat 6. The host
computer was running Windows XP Professional, Service Pack 2, with the
VMware Server 2.01 hypervisor. The Virtual machine is available for
http://www.opendap.org/pub/vm[download] on the OPeNDAP web site. Mostly
this is the basic process outlined above, but there were somethings that
took some sleuthing to discover - I've included those in block-quoted
sections in the example.

* I started with a fresh installation of Windows XP, SP2 and added
VMware Server 2.01.

* Copy the Virtual machine to the the Windows XP Host system. You can
use IE to do this and save the result on the desktop. Then move the file
to the _Virtual Machines_ folder made when VMware Server was installed
(mine was on the C drive).

* Start VMware Server. To do this, follow the link on the desktop, which
will open a browser window and access the VMware Server using a URL, or
open a browser window and type the URL __http://<machine name>:8333/__.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
With Internet Explorer 8 there's a warning about the SSL certificate
supplied by VMware Server. Tell IE8 to load the page anyway - it
recommends that you don't, but that's because it thinks you're trying to
access a remote site. To keep this annoying message from appearing every
time you start VMware Server, click on the right end of the URL display
area and configure the browser to accept this particular certificate all
the time without question.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* Add the VM you copied to the _Virtual Machines_ folder to the set of
VM's that VMware Server controls. To do this, click on _Virtual
Machines_ and then __Add Virtual Machine to Inventory__.

* Make sure the VMware Server 'console' plugin is installed. First,
click on the VM's name in the window pane on the left. Then click on the
_Console_ tab at the top of the center pane. If the plugin is not
installed, you see a message in yellow about installing it. Do so.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Later on I would upgrade from Internet Explorer 7 to 8, which 'broke'
the VMware Server Console. In fact this was really my lack of Win XP
experience showing - the VMWare Server software uses a plugin (ActiveX
control?) to provide a console to operate the VM. When I upgraded
Internet Explorer, I needed to go to the _Tools_ menu and __Manage
Addons__. To make the VMware Server console plugin active, choose
_Toolbars and Extensions_ and then _Show All_ in the menu on the left.
Set the VMware plugin so that its available for all sites. If the plugin
is installed but not made available, even if it was available under IE
7, then the message you'll get says the plugin is not available and asks
if you want to install it.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* At this point you should be able to start the VM and login. With the
VM selected in the left pane, click on the 'play' button and the VM
should boot. It may take a few seconds. Once started you should be able
to click on the _Console_ tab and see a 'terminal' window popup. Type a
return if you're not prompted for a username and password. The VMs all
come preconfigured with the username _opendap_ and the password
__opendap__. Login. You can change the password if you'd like. You have
full access to the VM using the _sudo_ command. To change the password,
use the command __passwd__.

* Now export the data from the Windows XP host. Open up a file browsing
window and navigate to the folder that holds the data you want to serve.
Select the folder and then choose _Share this Folder_ from the pane on
the left (I'm working from memory here - it might not be exactly like
that, but it's close). I believe Shared Folders are read-only by default
and that's probably what you want. If not, there's an option to allow
people to change the folder contents (make it read-write).

* Now mount the Win XP Shared Folder in the VM. Lets break this into two
steps. First collect information about the Host and VM and ensure that
the networking parameters are correctly set. Write down the IP number of
the Host computer by going to the _Control Panel_ and examining the
attached network devices. Next write down the IP number assigned to the
VM by going to the console and using the command _sudo /sbin/ifconfig
-a_ and noting the value for __eth0__. If _eth0_ is not listed and/or is
not marked 'UP' then follow the advice below regarding the **udev
hack**. With the two IP numbers in hand, check to make sure that the VM
is configured for NAT using the VMware Server's _Virtual Network Editor_
(found under the 'Start' menu's _vmware_ entry). Make sure _NAT_ is
enabled an the other two modes (host only and bridged) are disabled. At
this time you can use the _Virtual Network Editor_ to set up port
forwarding so requests to access a particular port on the Host computer
will be forwarded to the VM. To do this, select the _NAT_ tab and then
click on the _Port Forwarding_ button. In the dialog box that comes up,
use the IP numbers for the Host and VM and forward either port 8080 or
80 from the host to port 8080 on the VM. You can choose any port on the
host, although 80 is the default HTTP port and most people will that's
easiest. If you're already running a web server on the host, choose port
8080 to forward to avoid a conflict with the existing web server. At his
point an access to port 80 (or 8080) on you Host will be forwarded to
the VM on Port 8080, where you'll be running Hyrax. Connecting computers
will not know this forwarding operation is taking place - it will seem
as though they are using Hyrax on the Host computer.

There can be a odd wrinkle in getting the VM connected to the network.

 +
 *The udev hack* +
 I found that sometimes the VM would start with networking broken. I
don't see a pattern, but looking at the network devices using __sudo
/sbin/ifconfig -a__, eth0 is hosed (it does not say 'UP'). To fix this
problem, change directory to _/etc/udev/rules.d/_ and in the file
_70-persistent-net-rules_ remove the line about eth0 and edit the line
for eth1 replacing 'eth1' with 'eth0'. Restart udev and networking using
the eponymous scripts in /etc/init.d. Now ifconfig should show eth0 as
'UP' +
 *Network Access* +
 It may be that editing your _/etc/network/interfaces_ so it looks like
the one below will remove the need modify the _persistent-net-rules_
file above. Thanks to Marty Brewer at RRS, Inc for this information.

* Go back to the VM's console window. Since you're using Win XP to
export a folder, use the Linux Samba system to mount it within the Linux
directory tree. Since we don't bundle Samba with the VM, you'll have to
get it. Use the _apt-get_ system to install Samba: __sudo apt-get
install smbfs__. I've found that the apt-get system may need to be
updated in order for this to work, so you will likely have to do _sudo
apt-get update_ first. Now make a mount point in the VM for the shared
folder. I used _sudo mkdir /opt/Hyrax-1.4.2/share/hyrax/data/<my data>_
because Hyrax is already configured to read from
__/opt/Hyrax-1.4.2/share/hyrax/data/__. Finally, mount the Shared Folder
onto the new directory: __mount -t smbfs -o
username=<user>,password=<pw> //<host IP>/data
/opt/Hyrax-1.4.2/share/hyrax/data/satellite__.

* Next to last step. Make any changes to Hyrax need to serve the data.
For NetCDF, HDF4, HDF5 or FreeForm data sets, no changes should be
needed if you mounted the Shared Folder under
__/opt/Hyrax-1.4.2/share/hyrax/data__. If you chose another mount point,
edit the _bes.conf_ file in _/opt/Hyrax-1.4.2/etc/bes/_ so that the
_DirectoryRoot_ parameter points to that mount point. Next, if your
filenames are unusual (e.g., your NetCDF files don't use a _.nc_ suffix
but instead use something else) edit the _bes.conf_ file so that those
files will be recognized and associated with the NetCDF handler. Of
course, the same goes with HDF4 files and the HDF4 handler, et cetera.
This step is really a generic _Configure Hyrax_ step and you can find
instructions on that link:../index.php/Hyrax_-_Configuration[here].

* Start Hyrax. Goto the _/opt/Hyrax-1.4.2/_ directory and run the two
commands: _sudo bin/besctl start_ and __sudo ../tomcat/bin/startup.sh__.
There's more information about
link:../index.php/Hyrax_-_Installation_Instructions#Starting_and_Stopping_Hyrax[starting
and stopping] Hyrax in the main Hyrax documentation section.

* Test the server. Goto the Host computer and in a new browser window
type the URL _http://localhost/opendap/_ and you should see the server's
top-level page for the data you are serving. If you forwarded port 8080
instead of 80, us _http://localhost:8080/opendap/_ instead. Other
computers would use either your host's name or IP number, depending on
how your network is configured.
