= EDL Authentication

As of Hyrax 1.16.8 we have added extensive support for Earthdata Login User Authentication. 

For configurations that require Hyrax to authenticate to access various remote resources, Hyrax can now utilize `~/.netrc` (or a `netrc` file may be specified in `site.conf`) and Hyrax will use the appropriate credentials, if they are present.

As of Hyrax `1.16.8` we implemented support for EDL token chaining, and in the latest version Hyrax 1.17, we have fixed NASA/ESDIS Earthdata Login (EDL) token handling so that redirected are not issued and session (aka cookie) management is not required of the client.
