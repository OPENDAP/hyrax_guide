== Overview

This document is intended to help those that have been asked to deploy
Hyrax into an environment where authentication of users is required. In
many such cases Hyrax will be integrated into an existing instance of
the Apache Web server (__httpd__) where authentication services are
already configured and in use. In other cases people will be setting up
a standalone instance of Tomcat and will be needing to configure it to
use one of the supported authentication services. This document means to
address both situations.

== Terms

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication[Authentication] ::
  This is the process of confirming the identity of the user. The end
  result is a User ID (__uid__ or __UID__) which may be accessed by the
  software components via (both?) the Apache API (mod_*) and the Java
  ServletAPI (Tomcat servlets) used to trigger authorization policy
  chains or may be logged along with relevant request information.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider[Identity Provider (IdP)] ::
  Also known as an **Identity Assertion Provider**, an *Identity
  Provider (IdP)* is a service that provides authentication and identity
  information services. An *IdP* is a kind of provider that creates,
  maintains, and manages identity information for principals and
  provides principal authentication to other service providers within a
  federation, such as with web browser profiles.

 Service Provider (SP) ::
  A *Service Provider (SP)* is a Web Service that utilizes an IdP
  service to determine the identity of it's users. Or more broadly, a
  role donned by a system entity where the system entity provides
  services to principals or other system entities.

With respect to this document Hyrax/Tomcat, and Hyrax/Tomcat/Apache each
become part of an *SP* through the installation and configuration of
software components such as mod_shib (shibboleth) .

Providers, Identity Providers & Security Token Services explained] for

[[apache-httpd-auth-services-config]]
== Apache _httpd_ Authentication Services Configuration

There are many authentication methods available for use with our friend
_httpd_ and each of the three illustrated here has a unique installation
and configuration activity. There are some common changes that must be
made to the Tomcat configuration regardless of the authentication method
employed by Apache. We'll cover those first and then examine LDAP,
Shibboleth, and NASA URS IdP configurations for Apache __httpd__.

NOTE: If you are deploying Hyrax with an existing Apache service then
it is likely that all you have to do is configure _httpd_ and Tomcat
to work together and define and then define a security constraint for
_httpd_ that enforces a login requirement (valid-user) for Hyrax.

[[config-apache-tomcat-w-t]]
=== Configure Apache httpd and Tomcat to work together

In this part we configure Tomcat and Apache _httpd_ to work together so
that _httpd_ can provide proxy and authentication services for Hyrax.

==== Configure Apache

In `/etc/httpd/conf.d` create a file called *hyrax.conf* . Edit the file
and add following:

---- 
<Proxy *>
    AddDefaultCharset Off
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Proxy>
 
ProxyPass /opendap ajp://localhost:8009/opendap
ProxyPassReverse /opendap ajp://localhost:8009/opendap
----

NOTE: The ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse should be set to local host
unless a more complex deployment issuing attempted.

This will expose the web application "opendap" (aka Hyrax) through
Apache. Make sure that the AJP URLs both point to your deployment of
Hyrax.

==== Taking advantage of Apache Logging

Often when authentication is needed, it is also necessary to log _who_
has logged in and _what_ they have accessed. Apache has a very flexible
logging system; that can tell you what users asked for, where they came
from, and when they made the request - among other things. For specific
authentication technologies it may also be possible to log specific
information about UIDs, etc. See the sections below for information on
configuring Apache's log to record that kind of technology-specific
data.

==== Add SSL Capabilities to Apache

This step is not absolutely necessary, but it's quite likely you will
want to do this, particularly if you're going to use _https_ to access
the tomcat servlet engine running the Hyrax front-end. If you use https
in the AJP configuration as shown in the next section, you will need to
set up Apache to support https even if users don't access the server
with that protocol (because internally, some of the server's less
performance intensive functions work by making calls to itself, and
those will use https if you've set up tomcat to use https with AJP).
However, the configuration is very simple.

First, make sure you have mod_ssl installed. For CentOS 6, use _sudo yum
install mod_ssl_

Next make the needed certs. Here's how to make and install a self-signed
cert for CentOS 6:

----
# Generate private key 
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048 
 
# Generate CSR 
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
 
# Generate Self Signed Key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt
 
# Copy the files to the correct locations
cp ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs
cp ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
cp ca.csr /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.csr
----

Configure httpd to use the newly installed certs and restart:

* The configuration file is in: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
* Edit SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
* ... and SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
* and then restart: _sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart_

NOTE: More complete instructions can be found here:
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Https.

==== Configure Tomcat (Hyrax)

The primary result of the Apache authentication (the _uid_ string) must
be correctly transmitted to Tomcat. On the Tomcat side we have to open
the way for this by configuring a `AJP Connector` object. This is done
by editing the file:

$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml

Edit the server.xml file, and find the AJP Connector element on port
8009. It should look something like this:

---- 
<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" />
----

This line may be "commented out," with <!-- on a line before and --> on
a line after. If so, remove those lines. If you cannot find the AJP
connector element, simply create it from the code above.

* In order to receive authentication information from Apache, you must
disable Tomcat's native authentication. Set the tomcatAuthentication
attribute to "false" - see below for an example.
* If your Apache web server is using SSL/HTTPS (**and it should be**),
you need to tell Tomcat about that fact so that it can construct
internal URLs correctly. Set the scheme attribute to "https" and the
proxyPort attribute to "443" - see below for an example.
* For increased security, disable access to the connector from anywhere
but the local system. Set the address attribute to "127.0.0.1" - see
below for an example.

When you are finished making changes, your connector should look
something like this:

---- 
    <Connector 
        port="8009" 
        protocol="AJP/1.3" 
        redirectPort="443" 
        scheme="https"
        address="127.0.0.1" 
        enableLookups="false"  
        tomcatAuthentication="false" 
        />
----

 port ::
  The Connector will listen on port 8009.

 protocol ::
  The protocol is __AJP/1.3__.

 redirectPort ::
  Secure redirects to port _443_ which is the nominal Apache HTTPS port,
  rather than the default 8443 which is nominally directed to Tomcat.

scheme ::
  Ensures that the scheme is __HTTPS__. This is a best practice and is
  simple enough if the server is already configured for HTTPS. If your
  server is not configured to utilize HTTPS, then you'll either need to
  set the value of _scheme_ to "http" or you can undertake to
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/[configure your instance of
  Apache _httpd_ to support for TLS/SSL transport].

 address ::
  The loopback address (127.0.0.1) ensures that only local requests for
  the connection will be serviced.

 enableLookups ::
  A value of *true* enables DNS look ups for Tomcat. This means that web
  applications (like Hyrax) will see the client system as a host name
  and not an IP address. Set this to *false* to improve performance.

 tomcatAuthentication ::
  A value of *false* will allow the Tomcat engine to receive
  authentication information (the _uid_ and in some cases other
  attributes) from Apache __httpd__. A value of *true* will cause Tomcat
  to ignore Apache authentication results in favor of it's own.

Restart Tomcat to load the new configuration. Now the Tomcat web
applications like Hyrax should see all of the Apache authentication
attributes. (These can be retrieved programmatically in the Java
sServlet API by using HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser() or
HttpServletRequest.getAttribute("ATTRIBUTE NAME"). Note that
HttpServletRequest.getAttributeNames() may not list all available
attributes – you must request each attribute individually by name.)

=== Second: Configure Apache httpd to authenticate

Once Tomcat and Apache httpd are working together all that remains is to
configure a security restraint on the Hyrax web application and specify
the authentication mechanism which is to used to identify the user.

While the details of the Apache security constraints differ somewhat
from one *IdP* to the next what is consistent is that you will need to
define a security constraint on Hyrax inside the chain of *httpd.conf*
files. The most simple example, that you want all users of the Hyrax
instance to be authenticated, might look something like this:

----

# This is a simplified generic configuration example; see the sections below for the real
# examples for LDAP, Shibboleth or URS/OAuth2
<Location /opendap>
  AuthType YourFavoriteAuthTypeHere
  require valid-user
</Location>
----

Where the `require valid-user` attribute requires that all accessors be
authenticated and where _YourFavoriteAuthTypeHere_ would be something
like __Basic__, _UrsOAuth2_ or __shibboleth__.

Complete examples for LDAP, URS/OAuth2, and Shibboleth IdPs are
presented in the following sections.

==== LDAP
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ldap.html[mod_ldap],
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html[mod_authnz_ldap])

NOTE: You must first 
<<config-apache-tomcat-w-t, configure Apache and Tomcat (Hyrax) to work together>>
prior to completion of this section.

In order to get Apache httpd to use LDAP authentication you will have
configure an Apache security constraint on the Hyrax web application.
For this example we will configure Apache to utilize the

* Groups and Users:
** *mathematicians*

*** gauss
*** euler
*** euclid
** *scientists*

*** tesla

Create and edit the file `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ldap.conf`.

Add the following at the end of the file:

----

# You may need to uncomment these two lines...
# LoadModule ldap_module modules/mod_ldap.so
# LoadModule authnz_ldap_module modules/mod_authnz_ldap.so
 
# You may want to comment out this line once you have it working.

</Location>
----

Restart Apache httpd and you should now need to authenticate to access
anything in /opendap

What's happening here? Let's look at each of the components of the
*`<Location>`* directive:

 `<Location  /opendap>` ::
  The http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#location[Location]
  directive limits the scope of the enclosed directives by URL or
  URL-path. In our example it says that anything on the server that
  begins with the URL path of /opendap will be the scope of the
  directives contained within. Generally The `Location` directive is
  applied to things outside of the filesystem used by Apache, such as a
  Tomcat service (Hyrax).
 `Order deny,allow` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#order[Order]
  directive, along with the Allow and Deny directives, controls a
  three-pass access control system. The first pass processes either all
  Allow or all Deny directives, as specified by the Order directive. The
  second pass parses the rest of the directives (Deny or Allow). The
  third pass applies to all requests which do not match either of the
  first two. In this example first, all Deny directives are evaluated;
  if any match, the request is denied unless it also matches an Allow
  directive. Any requests which do not match any Allow or Deny
  directives are permitted.
 `Deny from all` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#deny[Deny]
  directive allows access to the server to be restricted based on
  hostname, IP address, or environment variables. The arguments for the
  Deny directive are identical to the arguments for the Allow directive.
 `AuthType Basic` ::
  The http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#authtype[AuthType]
  directive selects the type of user authentication for a directory. The
  authentication types available are Basic (implemented by
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_auth_basic.html[mod_auth_basic])
  and Digest (implemented by
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_auth_digest.html[mod_auth_digest]).
 `AuthName "Forum Systems Public LDAP Server-  Login with user id"` ::
  The http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#authname[AuthName]
  directive sets the name of the authorization realm for a directory.
  This realm is given to the client so that the user knows which
  username and password to send.
 `AuthBasicProvider ldap` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_auth_basic.html#authbasicprovider[AuthBasicProvider]
  directive sets which provider is used to authenticate the users for
  this location. In this example we are saying that an LDAP service will
  be configured to provide the authentication service.
 `AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authzldapauthoritative[AuthzLDAPAuthoritative]
  directive is used to prevent other authentication modules from
  authenticating the user if this one fails. Set to `off` (as in this
  example) if this module should let other authorization modules attempt
  to authorize the user, should authorization with this module fail.
  Control is only passed on to lower modules if there is no DN or rule
  that matches the supplied user name (as passed by the client).
 `AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389/dc=example,dc=com` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authldapurl[AuthLDAPURL]
  directive is used to define the URL specifying the LDAP search
  parameters. In this example the service is hosted at
  __`ldap.forumsys.com`__, on port __`389`__. The search will be for
  anyone associated with the domain components _`example`_ and _`com`_
  (aka __`example.com`__).
 `AuthLDAPBindDN "cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com"` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authldapbinddn[AuthLDAPBindDN]
  directive is an optional directive used to specify a
  _`distinguished name`_ (DN) when binding to the server. If not present
  *`mod_authnz_ldap`* will use an anonymous bind. Many servers will not
  allow an anonymous binding and will require that the Apache service
  bind with a particular DN. In this example the server is instructed to
  bind with the _common name_ (CN) _`read-only-admin`_ at
  _`example.com`_
 `AuthLDAPBindPassword password` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authldapbindpassword[AuthLDAPBindPassword]
  directove specifies the password to be used in conjunction with the
  **`AuthLDAPBindDN`**. In this example the password is the word
  __`password`__.
 `AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN off` ::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authldapgroupattributeisdn[AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN]
  directive is a boolean valued directive that tells _`mod_authnz_ldap`_
  wether or not to use the DN of the client username when checking for
  group membership. In our example the value is set to *`off`* so the
  clients _username_ will be used to locate the clients group
  membership.

`ErrorDocument 401 "Please use your username and password to login into this Hyrax server"`
::
  The
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument[ErrorDocument]
  directive specifies what message the server will return to the client
  in the event of an error. In this example we define a message to be
  returned for all 401 (Unauthorized) errors to help the client
  understand that they need to be authenticated to proceed.
 `Require valid-user` ::
  The http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#require[Require]
  directive selects which authenticated users can access a resource.
  Multiple instances of this directive are combined with a logical "OR",
  such that a user matching any Require line is granted access. In this
  case it's effect is to say that any valid user that has authenticated
  (via the LDAP server ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389 with the
  distinguished name components dc=example,dc=com) will be allowed
  access.
 `Satisfy any` ::
  The http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#satisfy[Satisfy]
  directive defines the interaction between host-level access control
  and user authentication. It may have a value of either *`Any`* or
  **`All`**. The any value indicates that the client will be admitted if
  they successfully authenticate using a username/password OR if they
  are coming from a host address that appears in an *`Allow from`*
  directive.

===== LDAP Authorization Constraints

The Apache module
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html[mod_authnz_ldap]
provides a fairly rich set of "`Require`" directives which can be used
to control (authorize) access to resources serviced by Apache. In the
example above the *`Require`* directive is quite simple:

---- 
   Require valid-user
----

Which says (since the defined authentication mechanism for the enclosing
*`Location`* directive is LDAP) that any LDAP authenticated user may be
allowed access to anything that begins with the URL-path **`/opendap`**.
While that may be adequate for some sites, many others will be required
to have more complex access control policies in place. The LDAP module
*`mod_authnz_ldap`* provides a rich collection of *`Require`* directive
assertions that allow the administrator much more finely grained access
control. Rather than provide an exhaustive discussion of these options
here we will provide a few basic examples and refer the reader to
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html[the
comprehensive documentation for the _`mod_authnz_ldap`_ module at the
Apache project].

Grant access to anyone in the _`mathematicians`_ group in the
organization __`example.com`__.

----

    AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389/dc=example,dc=com
    AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN on
    Require ldap-group ou=mathematicians,dc=example,dc=com
----

Grant access to anyone who has an LDAP attribute _`homeDirectory`_ whose
value is __`home`__.

----

    AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389/dc=example,dc=com
    Require ldap-attribute homeDirectory=home
----

Combine the previous two examples to grant access to anyone who has an
LDAP attribute _`homeDirectory`_ whose value is _`home`_ and to anyone
in the _`mathematicians`_ group.

----

    AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389/dc=example,dc=com
    AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN on
    Require ldap-group ou=mathematicians,dc=example,dc=com
    Require ldap-attribute homeDirectory=home
----

The possibilities are vast, but it is certainly the case that the
contents of the LDAP service against which you are authenticating, and
the richness of the group and attribute entries will in a large part
determine the granularity of access control you will be able to provide.

[[shibboleth]]
==== Shibboleth (mod_shib)

NOTE: You must
<<config-apache-tomcat-w-t, configure Apache and Tomcat (Hyrax) to work together>>
prior to completion of this section.

The Shibboleth wiki provides excellent documentation on how to get
Shibboleth authentication services working with Tomcat. This is
primarily an Apache _httpd_ activity.

Basically you need to
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPJavaInstall[follow
the instructions for a Native Java Install] and as you read, remember -
Hyrax does not use either Spring or Grails.

===== Installation

The logical starting point for this is with the
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPJavaInstall[Native
Java SP Installation]:

* https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPJavaInstall

But as far as the organization of the work is concerned it is really the
last page you need to process, as it will send you off to do a platform
dependent Shibboleth Native Service Provider for Apache installation
which needs to be completed, working, and configured before you'll
return to the
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPJavaInstall[Native
Java SP Installation] to enable the part where Tomcat and _mod_shib_
pass authenticated user information into Tomcat.

The document path on the
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPJavaInstall[Natvie
Java Install wiki page] will send you off to do Shibboleth Native
Service Provider installation which is platform dependent:

* https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/Installation
** Install a _Native Service Provider_ on your target system.
** In the initial testing section for Linux they suggest accessing the
Status page https://localhost/Shibboleth.sso/Status, but you may have to
use the loopback address to be able to do so:
https://127.0.0.1/Shibboleth.sso/Status

Return to the
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPJavaInstall[Native
Java SP Installation] and complete the instructions there.

===== Configuration

Once the SP installation is completed go to the Native SP Configuration
page:

* https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPConfiguration

Read that page and then follow the link to the instructions for Apache:

* https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPApacheConfig

Follow those instructions.

* Do not be confused by the section
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPApacheConfig#NativeSPApacheConfig-MakingURLsUsedbymod_shibGetProperlyRouted[Making
URLs Used by mod_shib Get Properly Routed]. While you must add this
_Location_ directive to "reveal" the shibboleth module to the world
don't think the URL https://yourhost/Shibboleth.sso is a valid access
point to the module. That URL may always return a Shibboleth error page
even if _mod_shib_ and _shibd_ are configured and working correctly.
* Read and understand the section
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPApacheConfig#NativeSPApacheConfig-EnablingtheModuleforAuthentication[Enabling
the Module for Authentication]

The Shibboleth instructions should have had you add something like this:

---- 
<Location /opendap>
  AuthType shibboleth
  ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
  require valid-user
</Location>
----

to __httpd.conf__. This will require users to authenticate to access any
part of Hyrax which may be exactly what you want. If you want more fine
grained control you may want use multiple `Location` elements with
different `require` attributes. For example:

---- 
<Location /opendap>
  AuthType shibboleth
  ShibCompatWith24 On
  require shibboleth
</Location>
<Location /opendap/AVHRR>
  AuthType shibboleth
  ShibCompatWith24 On
  ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
  require valid-user
</Location>
</apache>
----

In this example the first `Location` establishes Shibboleth as the
authentication tool for the entire _/opendap_ application path, and
enables the Shibboleth module over the entire Hyrax Server.

* Since there is no `ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1` line it does
not require a user to be logged in order to access the path.
* The `require shibboleth` command activates mod_shib for all of Hyrax.

The second `Location` states that only valid-users may have access
"/opendap/AVHRR" URL path.

* The `require valid-user` command requires user authentication.
* The `AuthType` command is set to `shibboleth` so _mod_shib_ will be
called upon to perform the authentication.

For more examples and better understanding see the
https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPApacheConfig#NativeSPApacheConfig-AuthConfigOptions[Apache
Configuration section of the Shibboleth wiki.]

==== URS OAuth2 (mod_auth_urs)

URS/OAuth2 is a Single Sign On (SSO) authentication flow that utilizes
HTTP redirects to guide client applications requesting an authenticated
resource to a central URS authentication point where they are
authenticated, and them redirected back to their requested resource.
This way user credentials, however they may be exchanged, are only ever
exchanged with a single trusted service.

The URS documentation, downloads, application registration, and
application approval all require URS credentials to access. Obtaining
URS credentials must be the very first activity for anyone wishing to
retrieve, configure and deploy __mod_auth_urs__.

Each new instance of _mod_auth_urs_ deployed will need to have a set of
unique application credentials. These are generated by registering the
new instance as an new application with the URS system. Because each
registered application is linked to a single _redirectUrl,_ each
different running instance of _mod_auth_urs_ will need to be registered
in order to successfully have the server redirect clients back from
their authentication activity.

===== Prerequisites & Requirements

* You must be a registered URS user in order to perform this
configuration. (First. Do this first.)
* You need mod_auth_urs (which you will likely have to build from
source; see below).
* You must register a web application and authorize it. See
<<obtain-app-creds, Obtain URS Application Credentials>>
below for more information on this. Note: You can register
your application with either the
https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile[Test URS System] or the
https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile[Main URS System].
* You must complete the section
<<config-apache-tomcat-w-t, Configure Apache and Tomcat (Hyrax) to work together>>.
* You will need the public facing domain name or IP address of your
server.

===== Building mod_auth_urs

The
https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/URSFOUR/Apache+URS+Authentication+Module[documentation
for mod_auth_urs] describes how to build the module from a clone of the
git repo, however we found that on CentOS 6 that process had to be
modified to include linking with the ssl library. Since it is a fairly
simple build, we'll duplicate it here with the caveat that a newer
version of the module might have a different build recipe, so if this
doesn't work,
https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/URSFOUR/Apache+URS+Authentication+Module[check
the official page].

With that said, to build the module for CentOS 6:

* Make sure you have the httpd-devel and ssl-devel packages are loaded
onto your host

----
sudo yum install httpd-devel openssl-devel
----

* Clone the mod_auth_urs git repo from the ECC system. You need a URS
login for this, but you need a URS login for several other steps with
this configuration as well

----
git clone https://<username>@git.earthdata.nasa.gov/scm/aam/apache-urs-authentication-module.git urs
----

* Build it using the apache extension build tool apxs in the _urs_
directory just made by the git clone command. Note that for CentOS 6 you
need to include the _ssl_ library and that you'll need to be root as it

===== Obtain URS Application Credentials

* With your browser, navigate to your URS profile page.
* Click the *My Applications* tab.

On the *My Applications* page:

* Click the *Create A New Application* button located under the
*Application Administration* section of the *My Applications* page.
* Fill out the form and save the information you enter into the form for
later.
** Make special note of the Application Username (UID) and password that
you submit and the _ClientID_ generated by the URS system.

This information is required in section *Compute the
Authorization Code* – the auth code is the hex conversion of the
application UID and password.

* Once you have registered the application you'll be able to see it in
your profile's *My Applications* tab.

Its status will show pending a while:

../index.php/File:URSApplicationPending.png[image:../images/b/b7/URSApplicationPending.png[image]]

Freshly registered application *tesy_tesy* awaits approval...

Once your application registration request passes through the approval
process in URS land its status will be changed to *Active* and your
instance of _mod_auth_urs_ will be permitted to interact with the URS
system. You should get an email acknowledging your application
registration and another one indicating that your application has been
activated. (The last time I did this it took ~20 minutes to receive the
activation notification. ../index.php/User:Ndp[ndp]
(../index.php?title=User_talk:Ndp&action=edit&redlink=1[talk]))

===== Approve your URS Application

Once your application is marked *Active* you will need to _approve_ it
so that the URS system knows that you are OK with the application having
access to your URS user profile information (not your password).

_*Every single URS user that is going to access your new server will
need to do this too.*_

On the *My Applications* page:

* Click the *Approve More Applications* button.

This will display the application search page:

../index.php/File:UrsApplicationSearch.png[image:../images/4/47/UrsApplicationSearch.png[image]]

URS Application Search Page

* Enter some or all of the name you picked (which became the UID) of
your new application and click the *Search For Applications* button,
this will bring you to the URS Application Approval page:

../index.php/File:UrsApproveApplication.png[image:../images/8/84/UrsApproveApplication.png[image]]

URS Application Approval Page

* Select your new application and click the *Approve Selected
Applications* button.

You will be returned to the *My Applications* page where you should now
see your new application on the list of **Approved Applications**.

../index.php/File:UrsApprovedApplicationList.png[image:../images/e/e0/UrsApprovedApplicationList.png[image]]

URS Approved Applications

===== Compute the Authorization Code

The last thing to do before configuring _mod_auth_urs_ is to compute the
authorization code for your freshly registered application. To do this
you will need to hex encode the Application Username (UID) and password
that you assigned to your application when you registered it. The are a
number of ways to generate the Authorization Code.

Use a simple perl script:

----

perl -e 'use MIME::Base64; print encode_base64("<uid>:<pw>");'
----

Or php script:

---- 
php -r 'echo base64_encode("<uid>:<pw>");'
----

Or shell script:

---- 
echo -n "<uid>:<pw>" | base64
----

Where _<uid>_ is the Application Username (UID) and _<pw>_ is the
password associated with your freshly registered application. The
resulting string of base64 encoded stuff is your application's URS
authorization code, aka UrsAuthCode in __mod_auth_urs__.

===== Configuration

The instructions for configuring the Apache module *mod_auth_urs* can be
found here:

https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/URSFOUR/Apache+URS+Authentication+Module

Notes:

* The instructions are clear and complete but you have to be a
registered URS user with permissions to access that page in order to
read it.
* Also note that the apxs tool used to build an apache module is part of
the _httpd-devel_ package and won't be available if you don't have that
package installed.

Once I had it installed all that was needed was to create the file
_/etc/httpd/conf.d/urs.conf_ and add the configuration content to the
file. The configuration file you'll find below is annotated and you will
need to review and possibly edit the values of the following fields:

* UrsAuthServer
* AuthName

And you MUST edit and provide your application credential information in
these fields:

* UrsAuthGroup
* UrsClientId
* UrsAuthCode
* UrsRedirectUrl

And you should review and possibly edit this value to point to an
appropriate page on your server for failed authentication:

* UrsAccessErrorUrl

Assuming that you have also:

* Completed configuring <<apache-integration, AJP proxy for Tomcat>>
* Authorized your server (aka Application) to access your URS profile.

Simply restart Apache and Hyrax is ready to be accessed with your URS
credentials.

==== Logging URS information

It is possible to get the Apache module to pull user profile information
into the request environment using the UrsUserProfileEnv configuration
directive:

---- 
UrsUserProfileEnv email_address URS_EMAIL
UrsUserProfileEnv user_type URS_TYPE
----

This can be added to a custom log format by including:

---- 
LogFormat ... %{URS_EMAIL}e ... \"%{URS_TYPE}e\" ...'''
----

Where we show the _URS_TYPE_ environment variable in double quotes
because their values often contain spaces. Thanks to Peter Smith for
this information.

See the full Apache
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_log_config.html[LogFormat
documentation] for more information.

=== Common Problems

==== Clients keep getting *Internal Server Error*

 
Problem:: Everything seems to work fine but when the browser client is
redirected back to the originally requested resource it receives an
*Internal Server Error* from Apache httpd. In
_/var/log/httpd/ssl_error.log_ you see this type of thing:

----
[Sun Mar 22 20:05:47 2015] [notice] [client 71.56.150.130] UrsAuth: Redirecting to URS for authentication, referer: https://52.1.74.222/opendap/data/contents.html

[Sun Mar 22 20:05:53 2015] [error] [client 71.56.150.130] UrsAuth: Failed to create new cookie, referer: https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/oauth/authorize?app_type=401&client_id=tNxluRHmczrTN1iSjXCMiA&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2F52.1.74.222%2FOPeNDAP%2Flogin&state=aHR0cHM6Ly81Mi4xLjc0LjIyMi9vcGVuZGFwL2RhdGEvaGRmNC9jb250ZW50cy5odG1s
----

This is often caused by the Apache httpd user not having read/write
permission on the directory specified by *UrsSessionStorePath* in the
httpd configuration:

---- 
UrsSessionStorePath /var/tmp/urs/session
----

Solution ::
  Check and repair the permissions of the directory specified by
  *UrsSessionStorePath* as needed.

== Tomcat Authentication Services Configuration

Tomcat provides a number of authentication Realm implementations
including the JNDIRealm which provides LDAP SP services for Tomcat.
There is currently no Shibboleth realm implementation for Tomcat, and
it's an open question for the author if there could be one for
Shibboleth or OAuth2 given the way that these protocols utilize 302
redirects away from the origin service.

=== LDAP

The
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/realm-howto.html#JNDIRealm[instructions
for configuring Tomcat to perform LDAP authentication are located here.]
It is clearly a benefit if you understand a fair bit about LDAP before
you undertake this.

Here is an example of how to configure Tomcat to use LDAP
authentication.

In this example we configure a Tomcat JNDI realm to use
http://forumsys.com[the public LDAP service provided by ForumSys].

In the _server.xml_ file we added a JNDI Realm element:

----

<Realm 
    className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm" 
    connectionURL="ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389"
    connectionName="cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com"
    connectionPassword="password"
    userPattern="uid={0},dc=example,dc=com" 
    roleBase="dc=example,dc=com" 
    roleName="ou" 
    roleSearch="(uniqueMember={0})"
/>
----

Configured to work with the
http://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/[Forum
Systems test LDAP server].

Then in the _opendap_ web application we added the following security
constraint to the _WEB-INF/web.xml_ file:

----

<security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
         <web-resource-name>Hyrax Server</web-resource-name>
         <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
         <role-name>user</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
 
    <user-data-constraint>
         <!-- this ensures that all efforts to access the admin interface nd resources must use HTTPS -->
         <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
----

 No changes were made to the _$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat_users.xml_
file.

=== Shibboleth

There is no actual Shibboleth integration with Tomcat beyond what is
provided by running the Apache _httpd_ module mod_shib and connecting 
Tomcat to _httpd_ using AJP 
<<shibboleth, as described in the Apache/Shibboleth section on this page>>.

=== URS OAuth2

There is no actual URS integration with Tomcat beyond what is
provided by running the Apache httpd module mod_auth_urs and 
connecting Tomcat to httpd using AJP 
<<apache-httpd-auth-services-config, as described in the Apache/URS section on this page>>.
